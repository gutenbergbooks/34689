<br /><i>AN OLD HOUSE</i></h2>
<p>At her desk in the assembly room of Riverview
High School, Penny Parker sat poised for instant
flight. Her books had been stacked away, and she
awaited only the closing bell to liberate her from a
day of study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; she whispered to her chum,
Louise Sidell, who occupied the desk directly behind.
&ldquo;We start for the old Marborough place right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dismissal bell tapped. Penny bolted down the
aisle and was one of the first to reach the door. However,
hearing her name called, she was forced to pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penelope, will you wait a moment please?&rdquo; requested
the teacher in charge of assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Nelson,&rdquo; Penny dutifully responded, but
she shot her chum a glance of black despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done now?&rdquo; Louise demanded in
an accusing whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; muttered Penny. &ldquo;About ten minutes
ago I clipped Fred Green with a paper ball, but
I don&rsquo;t think she saw me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of it as fast as you can,&rdquo; Louise urged.
&ldquo;Unless we start for the Marborough place within half
an hour we&rsquo;ll have to postpone the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the other pupils filed slowly from the room,
Penny slumped back into her seat. She was a tall,
slim girl with mischievous blue eyes which hinted of
an active mind. Golden hair was accented by a brown
sweater caught at the throat with a conspicuous ornament,
a weird looking animal made of leather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penelope, I don&rsquo;t suppose you know why I asked
you to remain,&rdquo; observed the teacher, slowly coming
down the aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Miss Nelson.&rdquo; Penny was far too wise
to make damaging admissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you about Rhoda Wiegand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Rhoda?&rdquo; Penny echoed, genuinely surprised.
The girl was a new student at Riverview,
somewhat older than the members of her class, and
lived in a trailer camp at the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>Miss Nelson seated herself at a desk opposite Penny,
thus indicating that she meant the talk to be friendly
and informal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penelope,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;you are president of the
Palette Club. Why has Rhoda never been taken in as
a member? She is one of our most talented art students.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the girls don&rsquo;t seem to like Rhoda very
well,&rdquo; Penny answered, squirming uncomfortably.
&ldquo;We did talk about taking her into the club, but nothing
came of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As president of the organization, couldn&rsquo;t you arrange
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Penny admitted, frowning thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do the girls dislike Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any special reason for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her poverty, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Penny defended the club
members. &ldquo;Rhoda is so quiet that the girls have never
become acquainted with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suggest that they make an immediate effort,&rdquo;
Miss Nelson ended the interview. &ldquo;The Palette
Club has no right to an existence unless it welcomes
members with real art talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of girls awaited Penny when she reached
the locker room. They eagerly plied her with questions
as to why she had been detained by the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later,&rdquo; Penny promised.</p>
<p>At the other side of the room Rhoda Wiegand was
removing a coat from her locker. A sober-faced girl
of seventeen, she wore a faded blue dress which seemed
to draw all color from her thin face. Knowing that
she was not well liked, she seldom spoke or forced herself
upon the other students.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda,&rdquo; began Penny, paying no heed to the
amazed glances of her friends, &ldquo;the Palette Club is
having a meeting this afternoon at the old Marborough
place. Why not come with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older girl turned quickly, a smile of surprise and
pleasure brightening her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should love to go, only I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;
Hesitating, she gazed at the other girls who were eyeing
her in a none too friendly way.</p>
<p>Penny gave Louise Sidell a little pinch. Her chum,
understanding what was expected, said with as much
warmth as she could: &ldquo;Yes, do come, Rhoda. We
plan to sketch the old wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have enough drawing material for both of us,&rdquo;
Penny added persuasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really want me, of course I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; Rhoda
accepted, her voice rather tremulous. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
about the Marborough homestead, and always longed
to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of subdued girls gathered their belongings
from the lockers, preparing to leave the school
grounds. No one understood why Penny had invited
Rhoda to attend the outing, and the act had not been a
popular one.</p>
<p>Boarding a bus, the twelve members of the Palette
Club soon reached the end of the line, and from there
walked a quarter of a mile into the country. Penny
and Louise chose Rhoda as their companion, trying to
make her feel at ease. Conversation became rather
difficult and they were relieved when, at length, they
approached their destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the old house,&rdquo; Penny said, indicating a
steep pitched roof-top which could be seen rising
above a jungle of tall oaks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been unoccupied for
at least ten years now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marborough homestead, a handsome dwelling
of pre-Civil war day, long had been Riverview&rsquo;s most
outstanding architectural curiosity. Only in a vague
way was Penny familiar with its history. The property
had been named Rose Acres and its mistress, Mrs.
James Marborough, had moved from the city many
years before, allowing the house to stand unpainted
and untended. Once so beautifully kept, the grounds
had become a tangle of weeds and untrimmed bushes.
Even so, the old plantation home with its six graceful
pillars, retained dignity and beauty.</p>
<p>Entering the yard through a space where a gate once
had stood, the girls gazed about with interest. Framed
in a clump of giant azaleas was the statue of an Indian
girl with stone feathers in her hair. Beyond, they
caught a glimpse of the river which curved around the
south side of the grounds in a wide bend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the old wishing well?&rdquo; Rhoda inquired.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so much about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to it now,&rdquo; Penny replied, leading
the way down an avenue of oak trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Not far from the house stood the old-fashioned covered
well. Its base was of cut stone and on a bronze
plate had been engraved the words: &ldquo;<i>If you do a good
deed, you can make a wish and it will come true</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people around Riverview really believe that
this old well has the power to make wishes come true,&rdquo;
Louise Sidell remarked, peering at her reflection mirrored
in the water far below. &ldquo;In the past years when
Mrs. Marborough lived here, it had quite a reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is still good if you don&rsquo;t mind a few
germs,&rdquo; Penny added with a laugh. &ldquo;I see that someone
has replaced the bucket. There was none here the
last time I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By means of the long sweep, she lowered the receptacle
and brought it up filled with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a wish, Penny,&rdquo; one of her friends urged.
&ldquo;Maybe it will come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone knows what she&rsquo;ll ask for!&rdquo; teased
Louise. &ldquo;Her desires are always the same&mdash;a bigger
weekly allowance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled as she drew a dipper of water from
the wooden bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the good deed?&rdquo; she inquired lightly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing worthy of a demand upon this old
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You helped your father round up a group of Night
Riders,&rdquo; Louise reminded her. &ldquo;Remember the big
story you wrote for the <i>Riverview Star</i> which was
titled: <i>The Clock Strikes Thirteen</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did prevent Clyde Blake from tricking a number
of people in this community,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged.
&ldquo;Perhaps that entitles me to a wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drinking deeply from the dipper, she poured the
last drops into the well, watching as they made concentric
circles in the still water below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old well, do your stuff and grant my wish,&rdquo; she
entreated. &ldquo;Please get busy right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is your wish, Penny?&rdquo; demanded one of
the girls. &ldquo;You have to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I wish that this old Marborough property
could be restored to its former beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe in making hard ones,&rdquo; Louise laughed.
&ldquo;I doubt that this place ever will be fixed up again&mdash;at
least not until after the property changes hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rhoda&rsquo;s turn now,&rdquo; Penny said, offering the
dipper to her.</p>
<p>The older girl stepped to the edge of the well, her
face very serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think wishes really do come true?&rdquo; she
asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only for the fun of it,&rdquo; Louise responded.
&ldquo;But they do say that in the old days, this well had
remarkable powers. At least many persons came here
to make wishes which they claimed came true. I
couldn&rsquo;t believe in it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda stood for a moment gazing down into the
well. Drinking from the dipper, she allowed a few
drops to spatter into the deep cavern below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; she said in a low, tense voice&mdash;&ldquo;I wish
that some day Pop and Mrs. Breen will be repaid for
looking after my brother and me. I wish that they
may have more money for food and clothes and a few
really nice things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awkward, embarrassing silence descended upon
the group of girls. Everyone knew that Rhoda and
her younger brother, Ted, lived at a trailer camp with
a family unrelated to them, but not even Penny had
troubled to learn additional details. From Rhoda&rsquo;s
wish it was apparent to all that the Breens were in dire
poverty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn now, Louise,&rdquo; Penny said quickly.</p>
<p>Louise accepted the dipper. Without drinking, she
tossed all the water into the well, saying gaily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Penny would grow long ears and a tail! It
would serve her right for solving so many mystery
cases!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girls made equally frivolous wishes.
Thereafter, they abandoned fun for serious work, getting
out their sketching materials. Penny and Louise
began to draw the old well, but Rhoda, intrigued by
the classical beauty of the house, decided to try to
transfer it to paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do nice work,&rdquo; Penny praised, gazing over the
older girl&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;The rest of us can&rsquo;t begin to
match it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have the sketch when I finish,&rdquo; Rhoda
offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>As she spoke, the girls were startled to hear a commotion
in the bushes behind the house. Chickens began
to cackle, and to their ears came the sound of
pounding feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the direction of the river, a young
man darted into view, pursued by an elderly man who
was less agile. To the girls, it was immediately apparent
why the youth was being chased, for he carried
a fat hen beneath his arm, and ran with hat pulled low
over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chicken thief!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed, springing to
her feet. &ldquo;Come on, girls, let&rsquo;s head him off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>BY THE COVERED WELL</i></h2>
<p>Seeing the group of girls by the wishing well, the
youth swerved, and fled in the opposite direction.
Darting into the woods, he ran so swiftly that Penny
realized pursuit would be futile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; she questioned the others. &ldquo;Did
any of you recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen him somewhere,&rdquo; Louise Sidell
declared. &ldquo;Were you able to see his face, Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older girl did not answer, for at that moment
the man who had pursued the boy ran into the yard.
Breathing hard, he paused near the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see a boy come through here?&rdquo; he asked
abruptly. &ldquo;The rascal stole one of my good layin&rsquo;
hens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw him,&rdquo; Penny answered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ll never overtake him now. He ran into the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the man muttered, seating
himself on the stone rim of the wishing well. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tuckered.&rdquo; Taking out a red-bandana handkerchief,
he wiped perspiration from his forehead.</p>
<p>Penny thought that she recognized the man as a
stonecutter who lived in a shack at the river&rsquo;s edge.
He was a short, muscular individual, strong despite his
age, with hands roughened by hard labor. His face
had been browned by wind and sun; gray eyes squinted
as if ever viewing the world with suspicion and hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you Truman Crocker?&rdquo; Penny inquired
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my tag,&rdquo; the stonecutter answered, drawing
himself a drink of water from the well. &ldquo;What
are you young &rsquo;uns doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, our club came to sketch,&rdquo; Penny returned.
&ldquo;You live close by, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down yonder,&rdquo; the man replied, draining the dipper
in a thirsty gulp. &ldquo;I been haulin&rsquo; stone all day.
It&rsquo;s a hard way to make a living, let me tell you. Then
I come home to find that young rascal making off with
my chickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who he was?&rdquo; asked Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but this ain&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;s paid me a visit.
Last week he stole one of my best Rhode Island Reds.
I&rsquo;m plumb disgusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda abruptly arose from the grass, gathering together
her sketching materials. As if to put an end to
the conversation, she remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will soon be dark, girls. I think I should start
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be leaving in a few minutes,&rdquo; Penny replied.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look around a bit more though, before
we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; worth lookin&rsquo; at around
here,&rdquo; the stonecutter said contemptuously. &ldquo;This old
house ain&rsquo;t much any more. There&rsquo;s good lumber in
it though, and the foundation has some first class
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you had designs on it,&rdquo; Penny
laughed. &ldquo;It would be a shame to tear down a beautiful
old house such as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it good for?&rdquo; the man shrugged. &ldquo;There
ain&rsquo;t no one lived here in ten or twelve years. Not
since the old lady went off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know Mrs. Marborough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we said howdy to each other when we&rsquo;d meet,
but that was the size of it. The old lady didn&rsquo;t like me
none and I thought the same of her. She never wanted
my chickens runnin&rsquo; over her yard. Ain&rsquo;t it a pity she
can&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a throaty sound, half chuckle, half sneer, the
man arose and walked with the girls around the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to look inside, there&rsquo;s a shutter off on
the east livin&rsquo; room window,&rdquo; he informed. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s
just like the old lady left it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean the furniture is still in the house!&rdquo;
Rhoda exclaimed incredulously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothing been changed. I never could
figure why someone didn&rsquo;t come in an&rsquo; haul off her
stuff, but it&rsquo;s stood all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their curiosity aroused, the girls hastened to the
window that Truman Crocker had mentioned. Flattening
her face against the dirty pane, Penny peered
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;The furniture is still
covered by sheets! Why, that&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; inquired Louise impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s hat lying on the table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be quite out of style by this time,&rdquo; Louise
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>new</i> hat,&rdquo; Penny said with emphasis. &ldquo;And a
purse lying beside it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the other side of the house, an outside door
squeaked. Turning around, the group of girls stared
almost as if they were gazing at a ghost. An old lady
in a long blue silk dress with lace collar and cuffs,
stepped out onto the veranda. She gazed beyond the
girls toward Truman Crocker who leaned against a
tree. Seeing the woman, he straightened to alert attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t Priscilla Marborough!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly have returned,&rdquo; the old lady retorted
with no friendliness in her voice. &ldquo;High time someone
looked after this place! While I&rsquo;ve been away, you
seemingly have used my garden as a chicken run!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did I know you was ever coming back?&rdquo;
Crocker demanded. &ldquo;Anyhow, the place has gone to
wrack and ruin. A few chickens more nor less
shouldn&rsquo;t make no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not to you, Truman Crocker,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
returned with biting emphasis. &ldquo;You know
I am home now, so I warn you&mdash;keep your live stock
out of my garden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her friends shared the old stonecutter&rsquo;s
chagrin, for they too were trespassers. Waiting until
the woman had finished lecturing Crocker, they offered
an apology for the intrusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry,&rdquo; Penny said, speaking for the
others. &ldquo;Of course we never dreamed that the house
was occupied or we wouldn&rsquo;t have peeped through the
window. We came because we wanted to sketch the
old wishing well and your lovely home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough came down the steps toward the
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite understand,&rdquo; she said in a far milder tone
than she had used in speaking to the stonecutter.
&ldquo;You may look around as much as you wish. But
first, tell me your names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one they gave them, answering other questions
which the old lady asked. She kept them so busy
that they had no opportunity to interpose any of their
own. But at length Penny managed to inquire:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough, are you planning to open up
your home again? Everyone would be so happy if
only you should decide to live here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; the old lady repeated, her eyes twinkling.
&ldquo;Well, maybe some people would be, and others
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Acres could be made into one of the nicest
places in Riverview,&rdquo; declared Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would take considerable money,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Marborough. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not made any plans yet.&rdquo;
Abruptly she turned to face Truman Crocker who was
staring at her. &ldquo;Must you stand there gawking?&rdquo; she
asked with asperity. &ldquo;Get along to your own land,
and mind, don&rsquo;t come here again. I&rsquo;ll not have trespassers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t changed a bit, Mrs. Marborough, not a
particle,&rdquo; the stonecutter muttered as he slowly moved
off.</p>
<p>Truman Crocker&rsquo;s dismissal had been so curt that
Penny and her friends likewise started to leave the
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go unless you want to,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
said, her tone softening again. &ldquo;I never could
endure that no-good loafer, Truman Crocker! All the
stepping stones are gone from my garden, and I have
an idea what became of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group of girls hesitated, scarcely knowing what
to do or say. As the silence became noticeable, Penny
tried to make conversation by remarking that she and
her friends had been especially interested in the old
wishing well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true that wishes made there have come true?&rdquo;
Rhoda Wiegand interposed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; the old lady smiled. &ldquo;Hundreds of
wishes have been made at the well over the years. A
surprising number of the worthwhile ones have been
granted, so folks say. Tell me, did you say your name
is Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; the girl responded, surprised that the
old lady had remembered. &ldquo;Rhoda Wiegand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wiegand&mdash;odd, I don&rsquo;t recall the name. Have
your parents lived many years in Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and father are dead, Mrs. Marborough.
My brother and I haven&rsquo;t any living relatives. Mr. and
Mrs. Breen took us in so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to go to an
orphans&rsquo; home. They have three children of their
own, and I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re quite a burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do the Breens live, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a trailer at the Dorset Tourist Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought I should enjoy living that
way,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough declared. &ldquo;Big houses are
entirely too much work. If I decide to clean up this
place, it will take me weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we all help you?&rdquo; suggested Louise impulsively.
More than anything else she longed to see the
interior of the quaint old house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear, but I shall require no assistance,&rdquo;
Mrs. Marborough replied somewhat stiffly.
Obviously dismissing the girls, she added: &ldquo;Do come
again whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the bus ride to Riverview, the members of
the Palette exchanged comments, speculating upon
why the old lady had returned to the city after such
a lengthy absence. One by one they alighted at various
street corners until only Rhoda, Penny, and Louise
remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, you&rsquo;ll have a long ride to the opposite side
of the city,&rdquo; Penny remarked as she and Louise prepared
to leave the bus. &ldquo;Why not get off here and let
me drive you home in my car? It won&rsquo;t take long to
get it from the garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be too much trouble,&rdquo; Rhoda protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to do it,&rdquo; Penny insisted. Taking the girl
by the elbow, she steered her to the bus exit. To
Louise she added: &ldquo;Why not come along with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will, if you&rsquo;ll drive your good car&mdash;not
Leaping Lena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was the proud possessor of two automobiles,
one a handsome maroon sedan, the other a dilapidated,
ancient &ldquo;flivver&rdquo; which had an unpleasant habit of
running only when fancy dictated. How she had obtained
two cars was a story in itself&mdash;in fact, several of
them. The maroon model, however, had been the gift
of Penny&rsquo;s devoted father, Anthony Parker, publisher
of Riverview&rsquo;s leading daily newspaper, <i>The Star</i>. He
had presented the car to her in gratitude because she
had achieved an exclusive story for his paper, gaining
astounding evidence by probing behind a certain mysterious
<i>Green Door</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Delighted with the gift, Penny promptly sold Leaping
Lena only to become so lonesome for her old
friend that she had bought it back from a second-hand
dealer. In towing the car home she was involved in
an accident, and there followed a chain of amazing
events which ultimately brought the solution of a mystery
case known as <i>Clue of the Silken Ladder</i>. Leaping
Lena and trouble always went together, according
to Louise, but Penny felt that every one of her adventures
had been worth while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind taking the maroon car,&rdquo; she replied to
her chum. &ldquo;In fact, Lena hasn&rsquo;t been running so well
lately. I think she has pneumonia of the carburetor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or maybe it&rsquo;s just old age sneaking up on her!&rdquo;
Louise added with a teasing laugh.</p>
<p>Reaching the Parker home, Penny ran inside to tell
Mrs. Weems, the housekeeper, that she was taking
Rhoda to the trailer camp. Returning a moment later,
she backed the maroon car from the garage with
dazzling skill and further exhibited her prowess as a
driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny always handles an automobile as if she were
enroute to a three-alarm fire!&rdquo; Louise assured Rhoda.
&ldquo;A reporter at the <i>Star</i> taught her how to drive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Presently, the car arrived at the Dorset Tourist
Camp, rolling through an archway entrance into a
tree-shaded area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our trailer is parked over at the north side,&rdquo; Rhoda
said, pointing to a vehicle with faded brown paint.</p>
<p>Penny stopped the car beneath a large maple tree.
Immediately three small children who had been playing
close by, rushed up to greet Rhoda. Their hands
and faces were very dirty, frocks unpressed and torn,
and their hair appeared never to have made contact
with comb or brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these the Breen youngsters?&rdquo; inquired Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rhoda answered, offering no apology for the
way the children looked. &ldquo;This is Betty, who is seven.
Bobby is five, and Jean is our baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise had no intention of remaining at
the camp, but before they could drive away, Mrs.
Breen stepped from the trailer. She came at once to
the car, and Rhoda introduced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always told Rhoda to bring her friends out
here, but she never would do it,&rdquo; the woman declared
heartily. &ldquo;Come inside and see our trailer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really should be going,&rdquo; Penny demurred. &ldquo;I
told our housekeeper I&rsquo;d be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will only take a minute,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen urged. &ldquo;I
want you to meet my husband&mdash;and there&rsquo;s Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman had caught a glimpse of a tall young
man as he moved hastily around the back side of the
trailer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ted!&rdquo; she called shrilly. &ldquo;Come here and
meet Rhoda&rsquo;s friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about it, Mrs. Breen,&rdquo; Rhoda said in
embarrassment. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; the woman replied, and called again.
&ldquo;Ted! Come here, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With obvious reluctance, the young man approached
the automobile. He was tall and slim with
many of Rhoda&rsquo;s facial features. Penny felt certain
that she had seen him before, yet for a minute she
could not think where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; the young man responded briefly
as he was presented to the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted found a little work to do today,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen
resumed proudly. &ldquo;Just a few minutes ago he brought
home a nice plump chicken. We&rsquo;re having it for dinner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted gazed over the woman&rsquo;s head, straight at his
sister. Seeing the look which passed between them,
Penny suddenly knew where she had seen the young
man. Mrs. Breen&rsquo;s remark had given her the required
clue. Unquestionably, Ted Wiegand was the one
who had stolen the chicken from the old stonecutter!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>CHICKEN DINNER</i></h2>
<p>The discovery that Rhoda&rsquo;s brother had stolen
food was disconcerting to Penny. Saying good-bye
to Mrs. Breen, she prepared to drive away from the
trailer camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t go so soon,&rdquo; the woman protested.
&ldquo;You must stay for dinner. We&rsquo;re having chicken and
there&rsquo;s plenty for everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really we can&rsquo;t remain,&rdquo; Penny declined. &ldquo;Louise
and I both are expected at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just afraid you&rsquo;ll put me to a little trouble,&rdquo;
Mrs. Breen laughed, swinging open the car door and
tugging at Penny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You have to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a cue from their mother, the three young
children surrounded the girls, fairly forcing them toward
the trailer. Ted immediately started in the opposite
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come back here, Ted Wiegand!&rdquo; Mrs. Breen
called in a loud voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner, Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know better,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen contradicted cheerfully.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just bashful because we&rsquo;re having two
pretty girls visit us. You stay and eat your victuals
like you always do, or I&rsquo;ll box your ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Ted agreed, glancing at Rhoda again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
no use arguing with you, Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Penny nor Louise wished to remain for dinner,
yet they knew of no way to avoid it without offending
Mrs. Breen. Briskly the woman herded them
inside the trailer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked proudly. &ldquo;We have a
little refrigerator and a good stove and a sink. We&rsquo;re
a bit crowded, but that only makes it more jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man in shirt sleeves lay on one of the day beds,
reading a newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet my husband,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen said as an afterthought.
&ldquo;Get up, Pop!&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
have any manners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man amiably swung his feet to the floor, grinning
at Penny and Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been very well lately,&rdquo; he said, as if feeling
that the situation required an explanation. &ldquo;The Doc
tells me to take it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was twenty years ago,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen contributed,
an edge to her voice. &ldquo;Pop&rsquo;s been resting ever
since. But we get along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Rhoda and Ted, who had followed the others into
the trailer, were acutely embarrassed by the remark.
Penny hastily changed the subject to a less personal
one by pretending to show an interest in a book which
lay on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that belongs to Rhoda,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen responded
carelessly. &ldquo;She brought it from the library. Ted and
Rhoda always have their noses in a book. They&rsquo;re my
adopted children, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Breen have been very kind to us,&rdquo;
Rhoda said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Breen retorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
more than earned your keep. Well, if you&rsquo;ll excuse
me now, I&rsquo;ll dish up dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise wondered how so many persons
could be fed in such a small space, especially as the
dinette table accommodated only six. Mrs. Breen
solved the problem by giving each of the three small
children a plate of food and sending them outdoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can eat in peace,&rdquo; she remarked, squeezing
her ample body beneath the edge of the low, anchored
table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little crowded, but we can all get in
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my plate outside,&rdquo; Ted offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you stay right here,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen reproved. &ldquo;I
never did see such a bashful boy! Isn&rsquo;t he the limit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having arranged everything to her satisfaction, she
began to dish up generous helpings of chicken and
potato. The food had an appetizing odor and looked
well cooked, but save for a pot of tea, there was nothing
else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having quite a banquet tonight,&rdquo; Pop Breen
remarked appreciatively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a drumstick, Ma, if
there ain&rsquo;t no one else wantin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take what you get,&rdquo; his wife retorted, slapping
the drumstick onto Penny&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>Louise and Penny made a pretense of eating, finding
the food much better than they had expected.
Neither Ted nor Rhoda seemed hungry, and Mrs.
Breen immediately called attention to their lack of
appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ted! What&rsquo;s the matter you&rsquo;re not eating?
Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head and got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry, Mom,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Excuse me,
please. I have a date with a fellow at Riverview, and
I have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Breen could detain him, he left the
trailer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand that boy any more,&rdquo; she observed
with a sad shake of her head. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been
himself lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger members of the Breen family quite
made up for Ted and Rhoda&rsquo;s lack of appetite. Time
and again they came to the table to have their plates
refilled, until all that remained of the chicken was a
few bones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Penny and Louise felt quite certain that Rhoda
realized what her brother had done and was deeply
humiliated by his thievery. To spare the girl further
embarrassment, they declared that they must leave.
However, as they were presenting their excuses, there
was a loud rap on the door of the trailer. Peering
from the curtained window, Mrs. Breen immediately
lost her jovial manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> here again,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What are we
going to tell him, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just give him the old stall,&rdquo; her husband suggested,
undisturbed.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Mrs. Breen went to open the door.
Without waiting for an invitation, a well-dressed man
of middle age entered the trailer. Penny immediately
recognized him as Jay Franklin, who owned the Dorset
Tourist Camp. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Mrs. Breen,&rdquo; he
began, his manner falsely cheerful. &ldquo;I suppose you
know why I am here again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the rent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; Mr. Franklin consulted a small booklet.
&ldquo;You are behind one full month in your payments,
as of course you must be aware. The amount
totals eight dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop, pay the gentleman,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I ain&rsquo;t got that much on me,&rdquo; her husband
rejoined, responding to his cue. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll drop
around in a day or two, Mr. Franklin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been stalling for weeks! Either pay or
your electric power will be cut off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Franklin,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Breen, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
do that to us. Why, with our refrigerator on the
blink, the milk will sour. And I got three little children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man regarded her with cold dislike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not interested in your personal problems, Mrs.
Breen,&rdquo; he said, delivering his ultimatum. &ldquo;Either
settle your bill in full by tomorrow morning, or
move on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>A RECORD ON ROCK</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Mrs. Breen murmured, gazing
despairingly at her husband. &ldquo;Where will we get the
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stepped forward into Jay Franklin&rsquo;s range of
vision. Observing her for the first time, he politely
doffed his hat, a courtesy he had not bestowed upon
the Breens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Franklin, have you a cheque book?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; he responded with alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll write a cheque for the eight dollars if that
will be satisfactory,&rdquo; Penny offered. &ldquo;The Breens are
friends of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will settle the bill in full, Miss Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whipping a fountain pen from his pocket, he offered
it to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, we can&rsquo;t allow you to assume our debts,&rdquo;
Rhoda protested. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Rhoda, it&rsquo;s only a loan to tide us over for a
few days,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen interposed. &ldquo;Ted will get a
job and then we&rsquo;ll be able to pay it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny wrote out the cheque, and cutting short the
profuse thanks of the Breens, declared that she and
Louise must return home at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Driving into Riverview?&rdquo; Mr. Franklin inquired.
&ldquo;My car is in the garage, and I&rsquo;ll appreciate a lift to
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to take you, Mr. Franklin,&rdquo; Penny
responded, but without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Enroute to Riverview he endeavored to make himself
an agreeable conversationalist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Breens are friends of yours?&rdquo; he remarked
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; Penny corrected. &ldquo;I met
Rhoda at school and visited her for the first time today.
I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling sorry for the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a no-good lot. The old man never works,
and the boy either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t get a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have many such families, Mr. Franklin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now and then. But I weed them out as fast as
I can. One can&rsquo;t be soft and manage a tourist camp,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Penny smiled, thinking that no person ever would
accuse Mr. Franklin of being &ldquo;soft.&rdquo; He had the
reputation of ruthless devotion to his own interests.
Changing the subject, she remarked that Mrs. Marborough
had returned to the city to take up residence
at Rose Acres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Mr. Franklin inquired, showing interest
in the information. &ldquo;Will she recondition the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny replied that she had no knowledge of the
widow&rsquo;s future plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt Mrs. Marborough has returned to sell the
property,&rdquo; Mr. Franklin said musingly. &ldquo;I should like
to buy that place if it goes for a fair price. I could
make money by remodeling it into a tourist home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a pity to turn such a lovely place into
a roadside hotel,&rdquo; Louise remarked disapprovingly.
&ldquo;Penny and I hope that someday it will be restored as
it was in the old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be no profit in it as a residence,&rdquo;
Mr. Franklin returned. &ldquo;The house is located on a
main road though, and as a tourist hotel, should pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation languished, and a few minutes later,
Penny dropped the man at his own home. Although
she refrained from speaking of it to Louise, she neither
liked nor trusted Jay Franklin. While it had been his
right to eject the Breens from the tourist camp for
non-payment of rent, she felt that he could have afforded
to be more generous. She did not regret the
impulse which had caused her to settle the debt even
though it meant that she must deprive herself of a few
luxuries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>After leaving Louise at the Sidell house, Penny
drove on home. Entering the living room, she greeted
her father who had arrived from the newspaper office
only a moment before. A late edition of the Star lay
on the table, and she glanced carelessly at it, inquiring:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s new, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing worthy of mention,&rdquo; Mr. Parker returned.</p>
<p>Sinking down on the davenport, Penny scanned the
front page. Immediately her attention was drawn to
a brief item which appeared in an inconspicuous bottom
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, how
strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says in this story that a big rock has been found
on the farm of Carl Gleason! The stone bears writing
thought to be of Elizabethan origin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that paper,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said, striding
across the room. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know any such story was
used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With obvious displeasure, the editor read the brief
item which Penny indicated. Only twenty lines in
length, it stated that a stone bearing both Elizabethan
and Indian carving had been found on the nearby
farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this item got past City Editor
DeWitt,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared. &ldquo;It has all the earmarks
of a hoax! You didn&rsquo;t by chance write it,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It reads a little like a Jerry Livingston story,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker said, glancing at the item a second time.</p>
<p>Going to a telephone he called first the <i>Star</i> office
and then the home of the reporter, Jerry Livingston.
After talking with the young man several minutes, he
finally hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Penny asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry wrote the story, and says it came from a reliable
source. He&rsquo;s coming over here to talk to me
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within ten minutes the reporter arrived at the
Parker home. Penny loitered in the living room to
hear the conversation. Jerry long had been a particular
friend of hers and she hoped that her father would
not reprimand him for any mistake he might have
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a chair,&rdquo; Mr. Parker greeted the young man
cordially. &ldquo;Now tell me where you got hold of that
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight from the farmer, Carl Gleason,&rdquo; Jerry responded.
&ldquo;The stone was dug up on his farm early
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. It was hauled to the Museum of Natural
Science. Thought I&rsquo;d drop around there on my way
home and look it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; requested the editor. &ldquo;While
the stone may be an authentic one, I have a deep suspicion
someone is trying to pull a fast trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve made a boner, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not blaming you,&rdquo; Mr. Parker assured him.
&ldquo;If the story is a fake, it was up to DeWitt to question
it at the desk. Better look at the rock though, before
you write any more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jerry arose to leave, Penny jumped up from her
own chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see that stone too!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Jerry,
do you mind if I go along with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; he said heartily.</p>
<p>Before Penny could get her hat and coat, Mrs. Maud
Weems, the Parker housekeeper, appeared in the doorway
to announce dinner. She was a stout, pleasant
woman of middle-age and had looked after Penny since
Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s death many years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, where are you going now?&rdquo; she asked, her
voice disclosing mild disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only over to the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not had your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;I dined on
chicken at the Dorset Tourist Camp. I&rsquo;ll be home in
an hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Jerking coat and hat from the hall closet, she fled
from the house before Mrs. Weems could offer further
objections. Jerry made a more ceremonious departure,
joining Penny on the front porch.</p>
<p>At the curb stood the reporter&rsquo;s mud-splattered
coupe. The interior was only slightly less dirty, and
before getting in, Penny industriously brushed off the
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about this interesting stone which was
found at the Gleason farm,&rdquo; she commanded, as the
car started down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to tell except what was in the paper,&rdquo;
Jerry shrugged. &ldquo;The rock has some writing on it,
supposedly similar to early Elizabethan script. And
there are a few Indian characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could such a stone turn up at Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl Gleason found it while he was plowing a field.
Apparently, it had been in the ground for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so if it bears Elizabethan writing!&rdquo;
Penny laughed. &ldquo;Why, that would date it practically
in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s written in the style used by the earliest settlers
of this country,&rdquo; Jerry said defensively. &ldquo;You know,
before we had radios and automobiles and things, this
land of ours was occupied by Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell!&rdquo; Penny teased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The natives camped all along the river, and there
may have been an early English settlement here. So
it&rsquo;s perfectly possible that such a stone could be
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I am curious to see it,&rdquo; Penny replied.</p>
<p>The car drew up before a large stone building with
Doric columns. Climbing a long series of steps to the
front door, Penny and Jerry entered the museum
through a turnstile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see the curator, Mr. Kaleman,&rdquo; the reporter
remarked, turning toward a private office near
the entrance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While waiting, Penny wandered slowly about, inspecting
the various display cases. She was admiring
the huge skeleton of a dinosaur when Jerry returned,
followed by an elderly man who wore spectacles.
The reporter introduced the curator, who began to
talk enthusiastically of the ancient stone which had
been delivered to the museum that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to show it to you,&rdquo; he said, leading
the way down a long corridor. &ldquo;For the present,
pending investigation, we have it stored in the basement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the verdict?&rdquo; Jerry inquired. &ldquo;Do museum
authorities consider the writing authentic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not wish to be quoted,&rdquo; Mr. Kaleman
prefaced his little speech. &ldquo;However, an initial inspection
has led us to believe that the stone bears
ancient writings. You understand that it will take exhaustive
study before the museum would venture to
state this as a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The stone couldn&rsquo;t have been faked?&rdquo; Penny asked
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always that is a possibility,&rdquo; Mr. Kaleman acknowledged
as he unlocked the door of a basement
room. &ldquo;However, the stone has weathered evenly, it
appears to have been buried many years, and there are
other signs which point to the authenticity of the
writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curator switched on an electric light which disclosed
a room cluttered with miscellaneous objects.
There were empty mummy cases, boxes of excelsior,
and various stuffed animals. At the rear of the room
was a large rust colored stone which might have
weighed a quarter of a ton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; Mr. Kaleman declared, giving the rock
an affectionate pat. &ldquo;Notice the uniform coloring
throughout. And note the lettering chiseled on the
surface. You will see that the grooves do not differ
appreciably from the remainder of the stone as would
be the case if the lettering were of recent date. It is
my belief&mdash;don&rsquo;t quote me, of course&mdash;that this writing
may open a new and fascinating page of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny bent to inspect the crude writing. &ldquo;&lsquo;Here
laeth Ananias&rsquo;&rdquo; she read slowly aloud. &ldquo;Why, that
might be a joke! Wasn&rsquo;t Ananias a dreadful prevaricator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ananias was a common name in the early days,&rdquo;
Mr. Kaleman said, displeased by the remark. &ldquo;Now
on the underside of this stone which you cannot see,
there appears part of a quaint message which begins:
&lsquo;Soon after you goe for Englande we came hither.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; questioned Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only my theory, you understand. I believe
the message may have been written by an early settler
and left for someone who had gone to England but expected
to return. The writing breaks off, suggesting
that it may have been continued on another stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, similar rocks may be found near here,&rdquo;
Jerry said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an interesting possibility. On the underside,
this stone also contains a number of Indian characters,
no doubt added at a later date. So far we have not
been able to decipher them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just why does the stone have historical value?&rdquo;
Penny interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there never was any proof that English
colonists settled in this part of the state,&rdquo; Mr. Kaleman
explained. &ldquo;If we could prove such were the case, our
contribution to history would be a vital one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Jerry asked many other questions, and
finally left the museum. Both had been impressed not
only with the huge stone but by the curator&rsquo;s sincere
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kaleman certainly believes the writing is genuine,&rdquo;
Penny declared thoughtfully. &ldquo;All the same,
anyone knows a carved rock can be made to look very
ancient. And that name Ananias makes me wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief may be right about it being a fake,&rdquo;
Jerry returned. &ldquo;But if it is, who planted the stone on
Gleason&rsquo;s farm? And who would go to so much unnecessary
work just to play a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frowning, the reporter started to cross the street
just as an automobile bearing Texas license plates went
past, close to the curb. As Jerry leaped backwards to
safety, the automobile halted. Two men occupied the
front seat, and the driver, a well-dressed man of fifty,
leaned from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he said, addressing Jerry, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
trying to locate a boy named Ted Wiegand. He and
his sister may be living with a family by the name of
Breen. Could you tell me how to find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jerry answered. &ldquo;I never heard
either of the names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I know both Ted and Rhoda Wiegand,&rdquo;
Penny interposed quickly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re living at the
Dorset Tourist Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we get there?&rdquo; the driver of the Texas car
inquired.</p>
<p>Jerry provided the requested information. Thanking
him, the stranger and his companion drove on
down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who they can be?&rdquo; Penny speculated,
staring after the car. &ldquo;And why did they come all the
way from Texas to see Rhoda and Ted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends of yours?&rdquo; Jerry asked carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Rhoda very much. Ted seems to be a rather
questionable character. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wonder what?&rdquo; the reporter prompted, helping
Penny into the parked automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just came to me, Jerry!&rdquo; she answered gravely.
&ldquo;Those men may be officers from Texas sent here to
arrest Ted for something he&rsquo;s done! I never meant to
set them on his trail, but I may be responsible for his
arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>STRANGERS FROM TEXAS</i></h2>
<p>Jerry smiled broadly as he edged the car from its
parking space by the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have a vivid imagination, Penny,&rdquo;
he accused. &ldquo;Those two men didn&rsquo;t look like plain-clothes
men to me. Anyway, if Ted Wiegand had
committed an illegal act, wouldn&rsquo;t it be your duty to
turn him over to the authorities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Penny admitted unwillingly. &ldquo;Ted
stole one of Truman Crocker&rsquo;s chickens today. It was
a dreadful thing to do, but in a way you couldn&rsquo;t blame
him too much. I&rsquo;m sure the Breens needed food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealing is stealing. I don&rsquo;t know the lad, but if a
fellow is crooked in small things, he&rsquo;s usually dishonest
otherwise as well. Speaking of Truman Crocker, he
was the man who hauled the big rock to the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; Penny inquired, not particularly interested
in the information. &ldquo;I understand he does a
great deal of rock hauling around Riverview. A queer
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becoming absorbed in her own thoughts, Penny had
little to say until the car drew up in front of the Parker
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; she invited Jerry as she
alighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tonight,&rdquo; he declined regretfully. &ldquo;I have a
date at a bowling alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker had been called downtown to attend a
meeting, Penny discovered upon entering the house.
Unable to tell him of her trip to the museum, she tried
to interest Mrs. Weems in the story. However, the
housekeeper, who was eager to start for a moving-picture
theatre, soon cut her short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Penny, but I really must be leaving or
I&rsquo;ll be late,&rdquo; she apologized, putting on her hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were interested in mystery, Mrs.
Weems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery, yes,&rdquo; smiled the housekeeper. &ldquo;To tell
you the truth, though, I can&rsquo;t become very excited
over an old stone, no matter what&rsquo;s written on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mrs. Weems had gone, Penny was left alone
in the big house. She sat down to read a book but soon
laid it aside. To pass the time, she thought she would
make a batch of fudge. But, no sooner had she mixed
the sugar and chocolate together than it seemed like a
useless occupation, so she set aside the pan for Mrs.
Weems to finish upon her return from the movie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; she thought suddenly. &ldquo;I
wonder why I didn&rsquo;t think of it sooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening to the telephone she called her chum,
Louise, asking her to come over at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; the other inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to carry out a philanthropic enterprise,
Lou! I&rsquo;ll tell you about it when you get here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days you&rsquo;ll choke on some of those
big words,&rdquo; Louise grumbled. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later she arrived at the Parker home
to find Penny, garbed in an apron, working industriously
in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what is this?&rdquo; Louise demanded suspiciously.
&ldquo;If you tricked me into helping you with the dishes,
I&rsquo;m going straight home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, relax,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;The dishes were
done hours ago. We&rsquo;re going to help out the Old
Wishing Well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would explain what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Lou. The Breens are as poor as
church mice, and they need food. At the Marborough
place this afternoon Rhoda made a wish&mdash;that her
family would have more to eat. Well, it&rsquo;s up to us to
make that wish come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re preparing a basket of food to take out to
the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the general idea. We can leave it on the
doorstep of the trailer and slip away without revealing
our identity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your idea is a splendid one!&rdquo; Louise suddenly
approved. &ldquo;Of course Mrs. Weems said it would be
all right to fix the basket of food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t mind. I know she would want me
to do it if she were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging open the porcelain door of the ice box,
Penny peered into the illuminated shelves. The refrigerator
was unusually well stocked, for Mrs. Weems
had baked that day in anticipation of week-end appetites.
Without hesitation, Penny handed out a meat
loaf, a plum pudding, bunches of radishes, scrubbed
carrots, celery, and a dozen fresh eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dash down to the basement and get some canned
goods from the supply shelf,&rdquo; she instructed Louise
briskly. &ldquo;We ought to have jelly too, and a sample of
Mrs. Weems&rsquo; strawberry preserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do the dashing, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; her chum
demurred. &ldquo;I prefer not to become too deeply involved
in this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems won&rsquo;t care&mdash;not a bit,&rdquo; Penny
returned as she started for the basement. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the
most charitable person in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a minute she was back, her arms laden with heavy
canned goods. Finding a market basket in the garage,
the girls packed the food, wrapping perishables carefully
in waxed paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! We can&rsquo;t crowd another thing into the
basket,&rdquo; Penny declared at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ice-box is as bare as Mother Hubbard&rsquo;s cupboard,&rdquo;
Louise rejoined. &ldquo;What will the Parker family
eat tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems can buy more. She&rsquo;ll be a good
sport about it, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no misgivings, Penny carried the heavy basket
to the garage and loaded it into the car. Discovering
that the gasoline gauge registered low, she skillfully
siphoned an extra two gallons from her father&rsquo;s car,
and then announced that she was ready to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever patronize a filling station?&rdquo; Louise
inquired as her chum headed the automobile down the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now and then,&rdquo; Penny grinned. &ldquo;After that
cheque I wrote for the Breens&rsquo; rent, I&rsquo;m feeling rather
poor. Dad is much better able to buy gasoline than I,
and he won&rsquo;t begrudge me a couple of gallons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have your family well trained,&rdquo; Louise
sighed. &ldquo;I wish I knew how you get by with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car toured through Riverview and presently
arrived at the entrance of the Dorset Tourist Camp.
An attendant stopped the girls, but allowed them to
drive on when he learned that they did not wish to
make reservations for a cabin. Penny drew up not far
from where the Breen trailer was parked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light is still burning there,&rdquo; Louise observed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be careful if we don&rsquo;t want to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny lifted the heavy basket from the rear compartment
of the automobile, she noticed another car
standing not far away. It looked somewhat familiar
and in studying it more intently she noted the license
plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s that same Texas car!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Those men must still be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What car? What men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this evening two strangers inquired the way to
this tourist camp,&rdquo; Penny explained briefly. &ldquo;They
said they were looking for Ted Wiegand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends of his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who they were or what they wanted.
It struck me as odd though, that they would come
from such a long distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever they are, they must be at the trailer now,&rdquo;
Louise said after a moment. &ldquo;Should we leave the basket
on the doorstep or wait until they&rsquo;ve gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t very well wait, Lou. They might decide
to stay half the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carrying the basket between them, the girls moved
noiselessly toward the trailer. Blinds had not been
drawn and they could see Mr. and Mrs. Breen, Rhoda,
and the two men seated at the table carrying on an
animated discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew why those Texas fellows came here,&rdquo;
Penny remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;If we wanted to find
out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not listen at any window!&rdquo; Louise cut her short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely thinking we <i>could</i>. Of course, I
never would do such an ill-bred thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Louise replied with emphasis.
&ldquo;For a very good reason too! I shall take you away
before temptation sways you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Depositing the basket of food on the trailer doorstep,
she forcibly pulled Penny to the waiting car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>A WISH FULFILLED</i></h2>
<p>At school the next morning, both Penny and
Louise eagerly awaited some indication from Rhoda
Wiegand that the basket of food had been discovered
by the Breen family. The girl had failed to appear at
five minutes to nine, and they began to wonder if she
intended to absent herself from classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, what did Mrs. Weems say about
last night&rsquo;s little episode?&rdquo; Louise asked her chum curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely too much,&rdquo; Penny sighed. &ldquo;She sent me
three thousand words on the budget problems of a
housekeeper! If you don&rsquo;t mind, let&rsquo;s allow the subject
to rest in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was time for the final school bell, and the two girls
started toward the assembly room. Just then Rhoda,
breathless from hurrying, came into the hallway. Her
eyes sparkled and obviously, she was rather excited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, something strange happened last night!&rdquo; she
greeted Penny and Louise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t possibly,&rdquo; Louise said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two baskets of food were left at the door of our
trailer! It&rsquo;s silly to say it, I know, but it seems as if my
wish at the old well must have had something to do
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say <i>two</i> baskets of food were left?&rdquo; Louise
questioned, gazing sideways at Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one came early in the evening. Then this
morning when Mrs. Breen opened the door, she found
still another. You don&rsquo;t suppose any of the members
of the Palette Club did it, do you? We shouldn&rsquo;t like
to accept charity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the girls if you want me to,&rdquo; Penny offered
hastily. &ldquo;If any of them did, nothing was said about it
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the old well granted your wish, Rhoda,&rdquo;
Louise added. &ldquo;You know, folks say it has a reputation
for doing good deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ringing of the school bell brought the conversation
to an abrupt end. However, as Louise and Penny
went to their seats, the latter whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose left that second basket on the
Breen doorstep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably one of the other club members had the
same idea you did,&rdquo; Louise responded. &ldquo;Anyway, the
Breens will be well fed for a few days at least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>At recess Penny made a point of questioning every
member of the Palette Club. Not one of the girls
would admit having carried the basket to the trailer
park, but all were agreed that Rhoda should be invited
to join the art organization. Without exception, they
liked the girl after becoming acquainted with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery deepens,&rdquo; Penny commented to Louise
as they wandered, arm in arm, about the school
yard. &ldquo;If no one in the Palette Club prepared the basket,
then who did do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to attribute it to the old wishing
well after all,&rdquo; Louise chuckled. &ldquo;Let me see your
ears, my pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for? Don&rsquo;t you think I ever wash them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely want to see if they&rsquo;ve grown since we
were at the Marborough place. Why, goodness me,
I believe they are larger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could think of a suitable retort, Rhoda
joined the girls. Curious to learn more of the two
Texas men who had arrived in Riverview, they gave
the newcomer every opportunity to speak of it. As
she remained uncommunicative, Penny brought up the
subject by mentioning that two strangers had asked her
how they might locate the trailer family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they found us all right,&rdquo; Rhoda replied briefly.
&ldquo;Mr. Coaten came to see Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old friend, I suppose,&rdquo; Louise remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. I can&rsquo;t figure out just why he did
come here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Rhoda frowned and lapsed into silence. Penny and
Louise did not question her further, and a few minutes
later recess ended.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Breen family concerned Penny
only slightly. Although she kept wondering why Mr.
Coaten and his companion were in Riverview, she gave
far more thought to the stone which had been dug up
on the Gleason farm. Directly after school she proposed
to Louise that they drive into the country and
interview the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the trip,&rdquo; her chum said, &ldquo;but why are
you so interested in an old rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad thinks the whole story may be a hoax.
I&rsquo;d like to learn the truth, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mindful that in the past Penny had brought the
<i>Riverview Star</i> many an important &ldquo;scoop,&rdquo; Louise
was very willing to accompany her on the trip. Four-thirty
found the two girls at the Gleason farm in conversation
with the old farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pestered to death ever since that rock was
found here,&rdquo; he told them somewhat crossly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing new to tell. I was plowing in the south field
back of the barn, when I turned it up. I didn&rsquo;t pay
much attention until Jay Franklin come along and said
the writing on it might interest the museum folks. He
gave me a couple of dollars, and paid to have old man
Crocker haul it to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Jay Franklin had an interest in the
stone,&rdquo; Penny remarked. &ldquo;You say he gave you two
dollars for it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the farmer nodded. &ldquo;I was glad to
have the rock hauled off the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied that they could learn no more, Penny and
Louise inspected the hole from which the stone had
been removed, and then drove toward Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gleason seemed honest enough,&rdquo; Penny commented
thoughtfully. &ldquo;If the rock was deliberately
planted on his farm I don&rsquo;t believe he had anything to
do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t sufficiently clever to plan and carry out an
idea like that,&rdquo; Louise added. &ldquo;Maybe the writing on
the rock is genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The curator of the museum thinks it may be. All
the same, I&rsquo;ll stack Dad&rsquo;s opinion against them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car approached the old Marborough place, and
Penny deliberately slowed down. To the surprise of
the girls, they observed two automobiles parked in
front of the property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if Mrs. Marborough has guests today,&rdquo;
Penny commented. &ldquo;Shall we stop and say hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Louise replied doubtfully as
the car drew up at the edge of the road. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not
really acquainted with her, and with others there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re leaving now,&rdquo; Penny said, jerking her
head to draw attention to a group of ladies coming
down the walk toward the street.</p>
<p>The visitors all were known to the two girls as
women prominent in Riverview club circles. Mrs.
Buckmyer, a stout, pompous lady who led the procession,
was speaking to the others in an agitated voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In all my life I never was treated with less courtesy!
Mrs. Marborough at least might have invited us into
her house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always understood that she was a queer person,&rdquo;
contributed another, &ldquo;but one naturally would expect
better manners from a Marborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t object to her manners if only she would
allow the Pilgrimage Committee the use of her house,&rdquo;
added a third member of the group. &ldquo;What a pity
that she refuses to consider opening it during the Festival
Week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still chattering indignantly, the women entered their
separate cars and drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you make of that?&rdquo; Louise asked in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently Mrs. Marborough gave them the brush
off,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;I know Mrs. Buckmyer heads
the Pilgrimage Committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard about it, Louise? A group of
club women decided to raise money by conducting a
tour of old houses. In this community there are a
number of places which date back over a hundred
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And people will pay money to see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the general idea. Festival Week has been
set for the twenty-sixth of this month. During a five-day
period the various homes are open, gardens will be
on display, and costume parties may be held at them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one colonial house that I&rsquo;d care about
getting inside,&rdquo; Louise said. &ldquo;I should like to see the
interior of Rose Acres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can do it now. Mrs. Marborough invited
us to visit her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but did she really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not find out?&rdquo; Penny laughed, swinging open
the car door.</p>
<p>Entering the grounds, the girls saw that very little
had been done to the property since their last visit. A
half-hearted attempt had been made to rake one side of
the lawn and an overgrown lilac bush had been mercilessly
mutilated. Shutters on the house remained
closed and the entire place had a gloomy, deserted
appearance.</p>
<p>Penny rapped on the door. Evidently Mrs. Marborough
had noted the approach of the two girls for
she responded to their knock immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; Penny began, &ldquo;we were driving
by and thought we would drop in to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice of you,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough smiled.
&ldquo;Look over the garden as much as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The garden&mdash;&rdquo; Louise faltered, gazing quickly at
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or make wishes at the well,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
went on hastily. &ldquo;Go anywhere you like, and I&rsquo;ll join
you as soon as I get a wrap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>The door closed gently in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to see a tangle of weeds?&rdquo; Louise demanded
in a whisper. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Marborough
invite us into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why indeed?&rdquo; echoed Penny, frowning thoughtfully.
&ldquo;There can be but one reason! She has a dark
secret which she is trying to hide from the world!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>PENNY&rsquo;S DISCOVERY</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hiding a secret, my eye!&rdquo; laughed Louise.
&ldquo;Penny Parker, sometimes I think that every person
in Riverview suggests mystery and intrigue to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you explain why Mrs. Marborough doesn&rsquo;t
invite us into her house!&rdquo; Penny challenged her chum.
&ldquo;And why did she turn the members of the Pilgrimage
Committee away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, probably the place isn&rsquo;t fixed up the way she
wants it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason. No, she has a different one than
that, Lou, and I&rsquo;m curious to learn what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always curious,&rdquo; Louise teased, taking
Penny by the arm. &ldquo;Come along. Let&rsquo;s get a drink
at the well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girls were lowering the bucket into the
bricked cavern, Mrs. Marborough joined them, a
woolen shawl thrown over her head and shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had time to get much work done yet,&rdquo; she
apologized. &ldquo;I really must hire a man to clean up the
grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have decided to make your home here?&rdquo;
Louise inquired eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present, I may. Much depends upon how
a certain project turns out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise waited hopefully, but Mrs. Marborough
said no more. Changing the subject, she inquired
about Rhoda Wiegand and the other members
of the Palette Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like young people,&rdquo; she declared brightly. &ldquo;Do
tell your friends to come to Rose Acres whenever they
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rather strange thing occurred yesterday,&rdquo; Penny
said suddenly. &ldquo;Rhoda made a wish here at the well,
and it came true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the wish?&rdquo; the old lady inquired with
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the people with whom she lives might have
more food. Two baskets were left at the trailer camp.
Louise and I were responsible for one of them, but we
can&rsquo;t account for the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough commented.
&ldquo;In years past, a great many wishes which were made
here, apparently came true. So I can&rsquo;t say that I am
surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what do you attribute it?&rdquo; Louise asked
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chance perhaps,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough smiled. &ldquo;One
cannot explain such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chill, penetrating wind blew from the direction
of the river. Shivering, Louise drew her jacket collar
closer about her neck, remarking rather pointedly that
the weather was turning colder. Even then, Mrs. Marborough
did not suggest that the girls enter the house.
A moment later, however, she excused herself and
went inside, leaving them alone in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem odd that she acts so secretive,&rdquo; Louise
commented. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with members of
the Pilgrimage Committee that her manners aren&rsquo;t the
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll finally decide that I am right!&rdquo;
Penny said triumphantly. &ldquo;Take my word for it,
there&rsquo;s something inside the house she doesn&rsquo;t want
anyone to see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise started slowly toward the road, only to pause
as her chum proposed that they walk to the river and
call upon Truman Crocker, the stonecutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intend to tell him who stole his chicken?&rdquo; Louise
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll let him discover it
for himself. I want to talk to him about that big rock
he hauled to the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise could not imagine what useful information
her chum might expect to gain, but she obediently
trailed Penny through the rear yard of Rose Acres,
down a sloping path which led to the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you know the way,&rdquo; she remarked dubiously
as the going became more difficult, and they
were forced to move slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t miss the cabin. Crocker&rsquo;s place is the
only one near here,&rdquo; Penny responded.</p>
<p>The trail was a narrow one, so infrequently used
that bushes and vines had overgrown it in many places.
Finally emerging on an open hillside, the girls were
able to gaze down upon the winding river. Recent
rains had swollen it to the very edges of the banks, and
from a distance Truman Crocker&rsquo;s shack appeared to
be situated dangerously close to the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think he would soon be flooded
out?&rdquo; Louise commented, pausing to catch her breath.
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care to live so near the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the water never comes much higher,&rdquo; Penny
rejoined. &ldquo;A few years ago the city built some sort of
river control system which takes care of the spill
should there be any. Anyway, Crocker&rsquo;s place
wouldn&rsquo;t represent much of a loss if it did wash away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls regained their breath, and then started
down the slope. Penny, who was leading the way,
did not pay particular attention to the rutty path.
Suddenly catching her shoe in a small hole, she tripped
and fell sideways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh, my arm!&rdquo; she squealed. &ldquo;I struck it on a big
rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise helped Penny to her feet, brushing dirt from
the girl&rsquo;s skirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ripped your stocking,&rdquo; she said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m lucky it wasn&rsquo;t my head,&rdquo; Penny returned
gazing ruefully at the tear. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down
and rest a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seating herself on the large smooth rock, she gingerly
examined a bruised place on her elbow. Louise
stood beside her, plucking burs from her chum&rsquo;s
sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; Penny said a moment later, getting
up. &ldquo;Why, Lou! Do you see what I&rsquo;ve been
sitting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rock, my pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone that looks exactly like the one at the museum!&rdquo;
Penny cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All rocks are pretty much alike, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Penny corrected. &ldquo;There are any
number of varieties. This one is quartz unless I&rsquo;m mistaken
and it <i>does</i> resemble the one at the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can find some writing on it,&rdquo; Louise
teased. &ldquo;The rock only weighs two or three hundred
pounds. Shall I lift it for you so you can see the under
side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Penny retorted, eagerly examining
the stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The writing! I <i>knew</i> this stone looked like the
one at the museum!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Louise was certain that her chum merely pretended
to have made such an important discovery. However,
as Penny continued to examine the rock in an intent,
absorbed way, she decided to see for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she exclaimed incredulously.
&ldquo;There <i>is</i> writing on the stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carved letters, so dimmed by age and weathering
processes that they scarcely remained legible, had been
cut unevenly in the hard surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Went hence vnto heaven 1599,&rsquo;&rdquo; Louise deciphered
slowly. &ldquo;Why, 1599 would date this stone almost
before there were known settlers in the country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost&mdash;but not quite,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;Historians
believe there were other settlements before that
date. Obviously, this is a burial stone similar to the
one found on the Gleason farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s such an old rock why was it never discovered
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stone may be a fake, but that&rsquo;s not for us to
try to figure out. We&rsquo;ve made an important discovery
and the museum is sure to be interested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that this is on Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
property,&rdquo; Louise reminded her chum. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to tell her about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retracing their way to Rose Acres, the girls
knocked on the door. Mrs. Marborough soon appeared,
looking none too pleased by their unexpected
return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, blocking the doorway so
that the girls could not see beyond her into the living
room.</p>
<p>Breathlessly, Penny told of finding the dated stone
on the hillside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know such a rock was there?&rdquo; she asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen any stone with writing on it,&rdquo; Mrs.
Marborough replied. &ldquo;Goodness knows there are
plenty of boulders on my property though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another stone similar to it was found yesterday on
the Gleason farm,&rdquo; Louise revealed. &ldquo;Do come and
see it, Mrs. Marborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the widow could reply, the three were startled
by heavy footsteps on the veranda. Turning, the
girls saw that Jay Franklin had approached without
being observed. Politely, he doffed his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I couldn&rsquo;t help overhearing your conversation,&rdquo;
he said, bowing again to Mrs. Marborough.
&ldquo;You were saying something about a rock which bears
writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found it on the hillside near here,&rdquo; Penny explained.
&ldquo;It has a date&mdash;1599.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be a mate to the stone discovered by
Mr. Gleason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take me to the spot where you found it?&rdquo;
Mr. Franklin requested. &ldquo;I am tremendously interested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Penny agreed, but her voice lacked
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>She glanced toward Louise, noticing that her chum
did not look particularly elated either. Neither could
have explained the feeling, but Jay Franklin&rsquo;s arrival
detracted from the pleasure of their discovery. Although
ashamed of their suspicions, they were afraid
that the man might try to take credit for finding the
stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>A MOVING LIGHT</i></h2>
<p>As if to confirm the thought of the two girls, Jay
Franklin remarked that should the newly discovered
stone prove similar to the one found at the Gleason
farm, he would immediately have it hauled to the Riverview
museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that for Mrs. Marborough to decide?&rdquo; Penny
asked dryly. &ldquo;The rock is on her land, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure,&rdquo; Mr. Franklin nodded,
brushing aside the matter of ownership as if it were of
slight consequence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough had gone into the house for a coat.
Reappearing, she followed Mr. Franklin and the two
girls down the trail where the huge stone lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever notice this rock?&rdquo; Penny questioned
the mistress of Rose Acres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but then I doubt that I ever
walked in this particular locality before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Jay Franklin stooped to examine the carving, excitedly
declaring that it was similar to the marking of the
Gleason stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here are other characters!&rdquo; he exclaimed, fingering
well-weathered grooves which had escaped
Penny&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Indian picture writing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for two types of carving on
the same stone?&rdquo; Louise inquired skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indian characters may have been added at a
later date,&rdquo; Mr. Franklin answered. &ldquo;For all we know,
this rock may be one of the most valuable relics ever
found in our state! From the historical standpoint, of
course. The stone has no commercial value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine the museum will want it,&rdquo; Penny said
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I was thinking.&rdquo; Mr. Franklin
turned toward Mrs. Marborough to ask: &ldquo;You would
not object to the museum having this stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It has no value to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then with your permission, I&rsquo;ll arrange to have it
hauled to Riverview without delay. I&rsquo;ll buy the stone
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The museum is entirely welcome to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a possibility that the museum will refuse
the stone. In that event you would have the expense
of hauling it away again. By purchasing it outright,
I can relieve you of all responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving Mrs. Marborough no opportunity to protest,
the real estate man forced a crisp two dollar bill into
her unwilling hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said jovially, &ldquo;now I am the owner of
the stone. I&rsquo;ll just run down to Truman Crocker&rsquo;s
place and ask him to do the hauling for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind was cold, and after Mr. Franklin had
gone, Mrs. Marborough went quickly to the house,
leaving the girls to await his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew something like this would happen,&rdquo; Penny
declared in annoyance. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s
stone, and the next thing we know, he&rsquo;ll claim that he
discovered it too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise nodded gloomily, replying that only bad luck
had brought the real estate agent to Rose Acres that
particular afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a sneaking notion he came here to buy Mrs.
Marborough&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Penny said musingly. &ldquo;He
thinks it would make a good tourist place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For half an hour the girls waited patiently. Neither
Jay Franklin nor Truman Crocker appeared, so at last
they decided it was a waste of time to remain longer.
Arriving at home, shortly before the dinner hour,
Penny found her father there ahead of her. To her
surprise she learned that he already knew of the stone
which had been discovered at Rose Acres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information certainly travels fast,&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;I suppose Jay Franklin must have peddled the story
the minute he reached town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he called at the <i>Star</i> office to report he had
found a stone similar to the one unearthed at the Gleason
farm,&rdquo; Mr. Parker nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> found it!&rdquo; Penny cried indignantly. &ldquo;Oh, I
knew that old publicity seeker would steal all the
credit! Louise and I discovered that rock, and I hope
you say so in the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Franklin let it drop that he will offer the stone to
the museum for five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the cheap tricks!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed,
her indignation mounting. &ldquo;He bought that rock for
two dollars, pretending he meant to give it to the
museum. Just wait until Mrs. Marborough hears
about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell me the facts,&rdquo; Mr. Parker invited.</p>
<p>Penny obligingly revealed how she had found the
rock by stumbling against it in descending a steep path
to the river. Upon learning of the transaction which
Jay Franklin had concluded with Mrs. Marborough,
Mr. Parker smiled ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Franklin always did have a special talent for making
money the easy way,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sorry
to see him cheat the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you don&rsquo;t think Mr. Kaleman will be foolish
enough to pay money for that rock?&rdquo; Penny asked in
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he may. He seems convinced that the
Gleason stone is a genuine specimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still believe the writing to be faked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Mr. Parker responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my reputation
upon it! I said as much to Jay Franklin today
and he rather pointedly hinted that he would appreciate
having me keep my theories entirely to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he doesn&rsquo;t understand you very well,&rdquo;
Penny smiled. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll be more determined than
ever to expose the hoax&mdash;if hoax it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s action thoroughly annoyed her for
she felt that he had deliberately deceived Mrs. Marborough.
Wishing to tell Louise Sidell what he had
done, she immediately telephoned her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned something you&rsquo;ll want to hear,&rdquo; she
disclosed. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t tell you over the &rsquo;phone. Meet
me directly after dinner. We might go for a sail on
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The previous summer Mr. Parker had purchased a
small sailboat which he kept at a summer camp on the
river. Occasionally he enjoyed an outing, but work
occupied so much of his time that his daughter and her
friends derived far more enjoyment from the craft
than he did.</p>
<p>Louise accepted the invitation with alacrity, and
later that evening, driving to the river with Penny,
listened indignantly to a colored account of how Jay
Franklin would profit at the widow&rsquo;s expense. She
agreed with her chum that he had acted dishonestly in
trying to sell the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mrs. Marborough can claim ownership
even now,&rdquo; she suggested thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not without a lawsuit,&rdquo; Penny offered as her
opinion. &ldquo;She sold the rock to Mr. Franklin for two
dollars. Remember his final words: &lsquo;Now I am the
owner of the stone.&rsquo; Oh, he intended to trick her
even then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car turned into a private dirt road and soon
halted beside a cabin of logs. A cool breeze came
from the river, but the girls were prepared for it, having
worn warm slack suits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand night to sail,&rdquo; Penny declared, leading
the way to the boathouse. &ldquo;We should get as far as
the Marborough place if the breeze holds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launching the dinghy, Louise raised the sail while
her chum took charge of the tiller. As the canvas
filled, the boat heeled slightly and began to pick up
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now use discretion,&rdquo; Louise warned as the dinghy
tilted farther and farther sideways. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well
to sail on the bias, but I prefer not to get a ducking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the trip up the river the girls were kept too
busy to enjoy the beauty of the night. However, as
the boat approached Truman Crocker&rsquo;s shack, the
breeze suddenly died, barely providing steerage way.
Holding the tiller by the pressure of her knee, Penny
slumped into a half-reclining position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to steer for awhile?&rdquo; Louise inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until we turn and start for home. We&rsquo;ll have
the current with us then, which will help, even if the
breeze has died.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Curiously, Penny gazed toward Truman Crocker&rsquo;s
cabin which was entirely dark. High on the hillside
stood the old Marborough mansion and there, too, no
lights showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone seems to have gone to bed,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;It must be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise held her watch so that she could read the
figures in the bright moonlight and observed that it
was only a quarter past ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we should be starting for home,&rdquo; Penny
said. &ldquo;Coming about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise prepared to lower her head as the boom
swung over, but to her surprise the maneuver was not
carried through. Instead of turning, the dinghy kept
steadily on its course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there
enough breeze to carry us around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was watching that light up on the hill,&rdquo; Penny explained.</p>
<p>Louise twisted in the seat to look over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What light, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone now, but I saw it an instant ago. There
it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unmistakably, both girls saw the moving light far
up the hill. As they watched, it seemed to approach
the dark Marborough house, and then receded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably someone with a lantern,&rdquo; Louise remarked
indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should anyone be prowling about Mrs.
Marborough&rsquo;s place at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deliberately, Penny steered the sailboat toward the
beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should investigate,&rdquo; she declared firmly.
&ldquo;Everyone knows Mrs. Marborough lives alone.
Someone may be attempting to break into the house!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>

<br /><i>MYSTERIOUS PROWLERS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, there must be a perfectly good reason
for that moving light,&rdquo; Louise protested as the boat
grated on the sand. &ldquo;You only want an excuse for
going to the Marborough place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; her chum acknowledged with a grin.
&ldquo;Jump out and pull us in, will you please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ankles are nice and dry and I like them that
way,&rdquo; Louise retorted. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all the same, you do the
jumping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;much.&rdquo; With a laugh,
Penny gingerly stepped from the dinghy into shallow
water. She pulled the boat farther up onto the shore
so that her chum was able to climb out without wetting
her feet. Together they furled the sail and removed
the steering apparatus which they hid in the nearby
bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a light now,&rdquo; Louise protested after
their various tasks had been completed. &ldquo;Must we
climb that steep hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; Penny declared firmly, taking her by
the hand. &ldquo;Something may be wrong at Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
and we ought to find out about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just love to investigate things,&rdquo; Louise accused.
&ldquo;You know as well as I do that there&rsquo;s not likely to be
anything amiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone may be prowling about the grounds! At
any rate, my feet are cramped from sitting so long in
the boat. We need exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding a trail, the girls climbed it until they were
within a hundred yards of the Marborough mansion.
Emerging from behind a clump of lilac bushes they
suddenly obtained an unobstructed view of the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the light!&rdquo; Penny whispered. &ldquo;See! By
the wishing well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their knowledge the girls had made no unusual
sound. Yet, apparently the person who prowled in
the yard was aware of their approach. As they
watched, the lantern was extinguished. Simultaneously,
the moon, which had been so bright, moved under
a dark cloud.</p>
<p>For several seconds the girls could not see the
shadowy figure by the well. When the moon again
emerged from behind its shield no one was visible in
the yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever was there has hidden!&rdquo; Penny whispered
excitedly. &ldquo;Louise, after we leave he may attempt to
break into the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ought we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should warn Mrs. Marborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house is dark,&rdquo; Louise said dubiously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
probably in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to know about it if someone
were prowling about your premises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; Penny urged, starting through the
tangle of tall grass. &ldquo;Mrs. Marborough should be very
grateful for the warning. It may prevent a burglary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In crossing the yard, the girls kept an alert watch of
the bushes but could see no one hiding behind them.
Nevertheless, they felt certain that the prowler could
not have left the grounds.</p>
<p>Penny pounded on the rear door of the Marborough
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud,&rdquo; Louise warned nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough probably is asleep. I want to
awaken her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny repeated the knock many times, and then was
rewarded by the approach of footsteps. The door
opened, and Mrs. Marborough, in lace night cap and
flannel robe, peered suspiciously at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked crossly. &ldquo;Why do
you awaken me at such an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember us?&rdquo; Penny said, stepping
into the light. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Startle me, fiddlesticks! I am merely annoyed at
being awakened from a sound slumber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry,&rdquo; Penny apologized. &ldquo;We
wouldn&rsquo;t bother you, but we saw someone with a lantern
moving about in the yard. We were afraid a
burglar might try to break into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough gazed carefully about the yard.
&ldquo;I see no light,&rdquo; she said stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone now,&rdquo; Louise admitted. &ldquo;As we came up
from the river, we distinctly saw it near the old wishing
well. Penny and I thought that whoever it was hid
behind the bushes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You both imagined you saw a light,&rdquo; the old lady
said with biting emphasis. &ldquo;In any case, I am not
afraid of prowlers. My doors have good bolts and
I&rsquo;ll be more than a match for anyone who tries to get
inside. Thank you for your interest in my behalf, but
really, I am able to look after myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Penny apologized meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, your intentions were good,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
said in a more kindly tone. &ldquo;Better go home
now and forget it. Young girls shouldn&rsquo;t be abroad at
such a late hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the door had closed, Penny and Louise slowly
retraced their way to the river&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someday I&rsquo;ll learn never to pay attention to your
crazy ideas, Penny Parker,&rdquo; Louise said, breaking a
lengthy silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the light, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so, but I&rsquo;m not sure of anything now.
It may have come from the main road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I disagree,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;Oh, well,
if Mrs. Marborough wishes to be robbed, I suppose it&rsquo;s
her own affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launching the dinghy, the girls spread their canvas,
and sailing before what wind there was, presently
reached the Parker camp. Penny&rsquo;s father awaited
them by the boathouse and helped to haul in the craft.</p>
<p>The girls did not tell Mr. Parker of their little adventure,
but the next day at school they discussed it
at considerable length. During the night no attempt
had been made by anyone to break into the Marborough
house. Nevertheless, Penny was unwilling to
dismiss the affair as one of her many &ldquo;mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still thinking about the affair as she wandered
into the library a few minutes before class time.
Rhoda Wiegand sat at one of the tables and appeared
troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Rhoda,&rdquo; Penny greeted as she searched for
a book on the shelf. &ldquo;You must have an examination
coming up from the way you are frowning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; the older girl asked, smiling. &ldquo;I was thinking
hard. The truth is, I am rather puzzled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like puzzles, Rhoda. If you have a knotty problem,
why not test it on me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you can help me with this one, Penny.
Do you remember those two Texas men I told you
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust them,&rdquo; Rhoda said briefly. &ldquo;Mr.
Coaten has offered to adopt Ted and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adopt you!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;Is that why they
came here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemingly, it is. Mr. Coaten wants to become our
legal guardian. I can&rsquo;t understand why he should
show such interest in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the Breens were looking after you and
Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took us in because we had no one else. We
never were adopted, and the truth is, we&rsquo;re a financial
burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Coaten an old friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never met him until he came to Riverview. He
and his friend, Carl Addison, claim they were closely
associated with my father. Neither Ted nor I ever
heard Papa speak of them when he was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem strange they should show such sudden
interest in you,&rdquo; Penny commented thoughtfully.
&ldquo;You have no property they might wish to control?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted and I haven&rsquo;t a penny to our names. Papa
never owned land, and what cash he had was absorbed
by his last sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps Mr. Coaten really is a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so, but I can&rsquo;t. Penny, I just
feel that he has a selfish purpose behind his apparent
kindness. It worries me because I can&rsquo;t figure it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course you&rsquo;ll not agree to the adoption?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, Penny. Ted favors it, and so does
Mrs. Breen. You see, Mr. Coaten has been very generous
with his money.&rdquo; Rhoda indicated a new dress
which she wore. &ldquo;He gave me this. He made Mrs.
Breen accept money, and he&rsquo;s giving Ted things too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s really a friend of the family&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe that he is,&rdquo; Rhoda interrupted.
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ringing of the school bell brought the conversation
to an end, but all during the morning Penny
thought of what the trailer-camp girl had told her.
Knowing nothing concerning the characters of the
two strangers, she could not judge their motives.</p>
<p>Another matter caused Penny considerable annoyance.
The morning paper had carried a brief item
about the record stone found at the Marborough mansion.
From her father she had learned that instead of
delivering the rock to the museum, Jay Franklin had
hauled it to his own home, offering it for sale to the
highest bidder. Penny felt that Mrs. Marborough
should be told what had occurred, yet neither she nor
Louise were eager to visit Rose Acres again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After last night I&rsquo;ve had enough of that place,&rdquo;
Louise declared as they discussed the matter. &ldquo;Mrs.
Marborough was very rude to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, we should tell her what Jay Franklin has
done,&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go right after school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Louise declined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve planned a shopping
tour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, immediately after dinner,&rdquo; Penny persisted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop by for you in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it developed, various duties kept both girls so
busy that it was dusk before they actually drove toward
Rose Acres. Louise protested that, considering
what had occurred the previous night, it was much too
late to call on the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough surely won&rsquo;t be abed before
eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Penny answered carelessly. &ldquo;If the
house should be dark, we can drive away without disturbing
her.&rdquo; Louise made another protest, but knew
that as usual Penny would get her way.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the automobile swung around a
bend. Directly ahead loomed the old colonial mansion,
its windows without lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well turn back,&rdquo; Louise observed.</p>
<p>Penny slackened speed, gazing toward the unkempt
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; she exclaimed tensely. &ldquo;There it is again!
The light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Louise demanded in disbelief. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the car passed beyond a tall clump
of azalea bushes bordering the property. Through its
branches both girls saw a light which appeared to be
motionless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lantern covered with a cloth to prevent a
bright glow!&rdquo; Louise discerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s close to the wishing well!&rdquo; Penny added
in a thrilled voice. &ldquo;Lou, there&rsquo;s something queer going
on at this place. Let&rsquo;s find out about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Louise asked, forgetting that she had decided
to have nothing more to do with her chum&rsquo;s
&ldquo;ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive past the house and park up the road,&rdquo;
Penny proposed with a delighted chuckle. &ldquo;Then
we&rsquo;ll steal back afoot and see what we can see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>BENEATH THE FLAGSTONES</i></h2>
<p>Louise offered no serious objection to Penny&rsquo;s
proposal, for she too was curious to learn who might
be prowling about the Marborough yard. Driving on
down the road for a considerable distance, they parked
the car just off the pavement and walked back to the
estate. A high hedge bounded the front side of the
Marborough property, but they were able to peer
through the scanty foliage into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be just our luck that the light has disappeared,&rdquo;
Penny muttered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; Louise whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Look over
there by the wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkness, both girls could see the faint glow
of a covered lantern which had been deposited on the
ground. A shadowy figure was bending over, examining
some object on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell who it is?&rdquo; Penny murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not from here. Dare we move closer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s risk it,&rdquo; Penny said, and led the way through
the open gateway.</p>
<p>Taking the precaution to keep tall bushes between
themselves and the wishing well, the girls quietly stole
closer. Soon they were near enough to distinguish
that someone in dark clothing was kneeling on the
ground, face turned away from them. Apparently
the person was trying to lift one of the flagstones
which formed a circular base about the covered well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can he be?&rdquo; Penny whispered, pausing.
&ldquo;And what is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the figure straightened, and the lantern
was lifted from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>she</i>, not a he!&rdquo; Louise observed in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like her from here,&rdquo; Louise nodded. &ldquo;But
what can she be doing at the well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely mystified, the girls remained motionless,
watching. Mrs. Marborough raised one of the flagstones
and peered beneath it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s searching for something,&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;Probably she works after dark so she won&rsquo;t be observed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident to both girls that the moving light
which had attracted their attention the previous night
had, undoubtedly, been Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s lantern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Although they now could understand the old lady&rsquo;s
irritation at their intrusion, her actions mystified them.
As they continued to watch, she pried up one stone
after another, frequently resting from her labors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might offer to help her,&rdquo; Louise proposed half-seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we show ourselves now she&rsquo;ll order us never to
return,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;We want to find out what
this is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next ten minutes the girls huddled behind
the friendly bush. At the end of that period,
Mrs. Marborough gathered together her tools, and
went wearily into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously she didn&rsquo;t find what she was after,&rdquo;
Penny said, coming from behind the shelter. &ldquo;What
do you suppose it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried treasure, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or possibly the family silverware hidden during
the Civil War,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.
Mrs. Marborough lived at Rose Acres all her early
years. If there had been anything valuable buried,
wouldn&rsquo;t she have done her searching long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a question, I can&rsquo;t answer it,&rdquo; sighed
Louise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our next move? Home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! Let&rsquo;s inspect the wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started forward, taking pains to avoid a patch
of light which came from the lower windows of the
Marborough house. Even in the semi-darkness the
girls were able to see that many flagstones about the
well had been removed and fitted again into place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just for luck I shall make a wish!&rdquo; Penny announced
unexpectedly, lowering the bucket into the
pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will it be this time?&rdquo; Louise inquired, slightly
amused.</p>
<p>Penny drank deeply of the cool, sweet water, and
tossed a token into the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that Rose Acres would give us a whopping
big mystery!&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;Lou, why did Mrs.
Marborough return to Riverview after being away so
many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is her ancestral home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but didn&rsquo;t she tell us that whether or not she
remains here depends upon certain conditions? Lou,
she must have had a very special reason for coming,
and it may be connected with this wishing well! We
ought to find out about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Penny fairly wailed. &ldquo;Oh, Lou, at times
you&rsquo;re the most exasperating person. Here we are
face to face with something baffling, and you wonder
why we should interest ourselves in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like mystery as well as you, but you know Mrs.
Marborough won&rsquo;t care to have us interfere in her
private affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; Penny conceded. &ldquo;Oh, well, we
can forget all about it if that&rsquo;s the way you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could we learn anything without provoking
Mrs. Marborough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no way,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;In fact,
she&rsquo;ll probably be irritated when I rap on her door
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise followed her chum down the path toward
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought we bother Mrs. Marborough now?&rdquo; she
asked in mild protest. &ldquo;She may think we have been
spying on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of course we never would consider doing,&rdquo;
Penny chuckled.</p>
<p>Paying no heed to Louise, she boldly clomped across
the veranda and knocked on the door. The girls did
not have long to wait. In a moment Mrs. Marborough
appeared, looking decidedly flustered and nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked sharply, and then recognized
the girls. &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough, do excuse us,&rdquo; Penny began
hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned something which I feel sure
you&rsquo;ll wish to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen another light in the yard perhaps?&rdquo; the
old lady inquired, her voice slightly mocking.</p>
<p>Penny glanced at Louise, uncertain what to say in
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no one in my yard either last night
or this evening,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough resumed tartly. &ldquo;I
appreciate your interest in my welfare, but I can only
repeat that I am quite capable of looking after myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We came to tell you about that big rock which we
discovered on the hillside,&rdquo; Penny interposed. &ldquo;Do
you care to hear what Jay Franklin did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite herself, Mrs. Marborough was interested.
She hesitated, and then came outside, carefully closing
the door behind her. The peculiar action was not lost
upon the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite chilly out tonight,&rdquo; Penny said significantly.
&ldquo;Perhaps it would be better to step inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind a little fresh air,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
replied. &ldquo;Now what is it that you wish to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling far from comfortable, Penny explained how
Jay Franklin had kept the big rock as his own property
and was endeavoring to sell it to the museum at a handsome
profit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he told me he would give the stone to the institution!&rdquo;
Mrs. Marborough exclaimed indignantly.
&ldquo;Will you see Mr. Franklin tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; Penny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you do, ask him to come here and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the matter were completely settled, Mrs. Marborough
started to re&euml;nter the house. She did not invite
the girls to accompany her. However, sensing
that they were puzzled by her lack of hospitality she
said apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would invite you in only the house isn&rsquo;t fixed up
yet. After everything is cleaned and straightened, you
both must come to tea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Without giving the girls an opportunity to say that
they shouldn&rsquo;t mind a disorderly house, she gently
closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least Mrs. Marborough didn&rsquo;t slam it in
our faces this time,&rdquo; Penny remarked cheerfully.
&ldquo;Lou, we&rsquo;re making progress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Progress toward what?&rdquo; Louise demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet,&rdquo; Penny laughed as they started
for their car. &ldquo;All the same, I have a feeling that we&rsquo;re
on our way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>JAY FRANKLIN&rsquo;S TRICKERY</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Dad,&rdquo; Penny greeted her father as she
slid into a vacant chair at the breakfast table. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
news and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No news.&rdquo; Mr. Parker lowered his paper, and
folding it, devoted himself to a plate of bacon and eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just fourteen pages of well-set type, I suppose.
Isn&rsquo;t there anything about that big stone Lou and I
found at the Marborough place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a line. I told you the <i>Star</i> would play that
yarn down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so convinced it&rsquo;s all a hoax?&rdquo; Penny
demanded, reaching across the table for the coffee
percolator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I give you a diagram?&rdquo; the publisher asked
wearily. &ldquo;After you&rsquo;ve been in the newspaper business
as long as I have, you don&rsquo;t need reasons. You
sense things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just like a bloodhound!&rdquo; Penny teased. &ldquo;How
about the other papers? Aren&rsquo;t they carrying the
story either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted a bit grimly.
&ldquo;The <i>News</i> used a half page of pictures today and
went for the story in a big way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may subscribe to a rival paper just to keep posted
on the latest developments,&rdquo; Penny teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing really new has come out. Jay Franklin
is trying to sell the Marborough stone to the museum at
a fancy price, and the institution officials are seriously
considering his proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in their opinion the stone is an authentic
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experts have been known to be wrong,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker insisted. &ldquo;I claim no knowledge of ancient
writing, but I do have common sense. For the time
being, at least, I shall continue to play down the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny finished breakfast, and before starting to
school, telephoned Jay Franklin. Relaying Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
message, she requested him to visit the old
lady as soon as it was convenient. Somewhat to her
surprise he promised that he would call at Rose Acres
that afternoon.</p>
<p>During school, Penny kept thinking about the Marborough
stone and her father&rsquo;s theory that the writing
and symbols it bore were fakes. It occurred to her
that Truman Crocker&rsquo;s opinion might be interesting
for the old man had worked with rocks his entire life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hike out to his shack this afternoon,&rdquo; she impulsively
proposed to Louise Sidell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; her chum agreed. &ldquo;Why not invite
Rhoda too? She might enjoy accompanying us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon being approached, the trailer camp girl immediately
accepted the invitation. Since the last meeting
of the Palette Club nearly all of the students had been
very kind to her, but she seemed rather indifferent to
everyone save Louise and Penny.</p>
<p>As the three girls trudged along the dusty road en-route
to the river shack, Rhoda spoke of Mr. Coaten
and his friend who still remained in Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve taken a room at the Riverview Hotel,&rdquo;
she told Penny and Louise. &ldquo;Perhaps I am too suspicious,
but I don&rsquo;t trust them. Mr. Coaten never
would seem like a father to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo; Louise questioned curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife remained in Dallas. The Coatens have
two children of their own. I can&rsquo;t understand why
they should be so eager to adopt two more&mdash;penniless
at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; Louise inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Ted and I are deadlocked. He
favors the adoption, but I am against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are wise to be cautious&mdash;and my advice
is &lsquo;stand firm,&rsquo;&rdquo; Penny declared promptly. &ldquo;The
Breens were kind enough to take you in when you had
no friends, so why not stay on with them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; Rhoda confessed. &ldquo;They
haven&rsquo;t much money, you know, and Mr. Coaten has
offered to give them a hundred dollars if they make
no objection to the adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buying them off?&rdquo; Penny commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, yes. But why should Mr. Coaten be so
interested in adopting Ted and me? We&rsquo;ll certainly
be a financial liability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem was such a perplexing one that neither
Penny nor Louise could offer any convincing answer.
Considering everything Rhoda had told them it appeared
that Mr. Coaten must be motivated entirely by
generosity. Yet, it seemed odd that if he were an old
family friend he had not interested himself in their
case at the time of Mr. Wiegand&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Choosing a trail which led along the river, the girls
soon came to Truman Crocker&rsquo;s shack. It was a long,
one-story frame building which served the dual purpose
of dwelling and shop. The door of the workroom
stood ajar, and the stonecutter could be seen
grinding a granite block.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; Penny said in a loud voice to
make herself heard.</p>
<p>The stonecutter jumped from surprise and switched
off a running motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scared me out of a year&rsquo;s growth,&rdquo; he grinned.
&ldquo;Well, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of anything,&rdquo; Penny responded, glancing
with interest about the cluttered workshop. &ldquo;We
were just out for a walk and thought we would stop
in for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her attention drawn to a large rock which had been
covered with wet sacking, she crossed the room to
examine it. Iron filings had been sprinkled on the covering,
and she knew that they must have a special purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this for?&rdquo; she inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m removing discoloration from a stone,&rdquo; Mr.
Crocker answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the sacking. Leave
it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do with the rock after you finish
working on it?&rdquo; Louise asked, crossing the room to
stand beside Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sell it,&rdquo; Mr. Crocker returned briefly. &ldquo;I have
work to do, and I&rsquo;m waiting to get at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you,&rdquo; Penny apologized.
&ldquo;The truth is, we came here to ask you about
that stone you hauled for Jay Franklin. Do you think
the writing on it is genuine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is. Anyone who knows anything about
stones could tell it had been lying in the ground for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aging couldn&rsquo;t have been faked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what is this?&rdquo; Crocker demanded, scowling.
&ldquo;What are you trying to get at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, who publishes the <i>Star</i>, believes that
someone may be perpetrating a hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; Crocker asked, puzzled by the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke. He thinks that some <i>clever</i> person may
have faked the writing on the two stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t have nothing to do with it,&rdquo; Truman
Crocker declared, his tone unpleasant. &ldquo;I hauled the
rock for Jay Franklin and that&rsquo;s all I know about it.
Now go away and don&rsquo;t pester me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the same as absent right now,&rdquo; Penny
laughed, retreating to the doorway. &ldquo;Thanks for your
splendid cooperation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Penny replied.
&ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A safe distance from the shack, the three girls expressed
their opinion of the old stonecutter&rsquo;s manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted as if we were suspicious of him,&rdquo; Louise
declared. &ldquo;Such a simple fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never once entered my head that Crocker could
have any connection with the hoax, assuming that the
writing isn&rsquo;t genuine,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;But now that I
think of it, why wouldn&rsquo;t he be a logical person to do
such a trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s far too stupid,&rdquo; Louise maintained. &ldquo;Why, I
doubt that he ever went through eighth grade in
school. Likely he never even heard of Elizabethan
writing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All true,&rdquo; Penny conceded, &ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t someone
have employed him? If he were told to carve a rock
in such and such a manner, I&rsquo;m sure he could carry out
instructions perfectly. He knows more about such
work than anyone in this community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, you&rsquo;re quite hopeless!&rdquo; Louise laughed.
&ldquo;Just let anyone rebuff you, and immediately you try
to pin a crime on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing Truman Crocker of anything&mdash;at
least not yet. All the same, those two stones were
found quite close to his shack. The Gleason farm isn&rsquo;t
more than three-quarters of a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Mr. Crocker be interested in playing
such a joke?&rdquo; Rhoda inquired dubiously. &ldquo;Or for that
matter, any other person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure it out,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged. &ldquo;If
the stones are fakes, one would judge them to be the
creation of a rather brilliant practical joker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t do it yourself?&rdquo; Louise
asked teasingly. &ldquo;After all, you were the one who
found the second stone, so that throws suspicion on
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny allowed the subject to die. With a quick
change of interest, she suggested to her companions
that they return to Riverview by way of the Marborough
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;re showing ourselves there too
frequently,&rdquo; Louise protested mildly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s such
a thing as wearing out one&rsquo;s welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we needn&rsquo;t try to break into the house.&rdquo;
Penny grinned. &ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t go there, we&rsquo;ll never
learn any more about the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise and Rhoda were not particularly eager to
climb the hill. However, to oblige Penny they offered
no objection to her proposal.</p>
<p>Approaching the Marborough property five minutes
later, the girls were startled to hear loud, angry
voices. The sound came from the direction of the
old wishing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is having a fearful argument!&rdquo; Penny declared,
quickening her step.</p>
<p>As the three friends emerged into the clearing they
saw Mrs. Marborough and Jay Franklin sitting together
on a garden bench. The widow was speaking
in a high-pitched voice, reprimanding the caller for
having misled her regarding the record stone found on
her land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s giving it to him right, and I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo; Penny
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not go any closer,&rdquo; Louise murmured, holding
back.</p>
<p>Penny stared at her chum in blank amazement.
&ldquo;Not go closer?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Why, this is why
we came! I thought Mr. Franklin might be here, and
I want to hear what he has to say for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>NO ADMITTANCE</i></h2>
<p>Neither Louise nor Rhoda approved of interfering
in the argument between Mrs. Marborough and
Mr. Franklin, but as usual they could not stand firm
against Penny. Making considerable noise to give
warning of their approach, the girls drew near the
garden bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your conduct has amazed and disappointed me,&rdquo;
they heard the old lady say in clipped words. &ldquo;When
I allowed you to remove the stone from my yard you
promised that you would deliver it to the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have mentioned such a possibility, but I made
no promise,&rdquo; Mr. Franklin replied. &ldquo;You sold the
rock to me. It is now mine to do with as I see fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deliberately tricked me! I am less concerned
with the money than with the fact that you are trying
to force the museum to pay for something which I
meant them to have free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough, you sold the rock for two dollars.
Unless I am very much mistaken, that money
meant more to you than you would have the townspeople
believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough arose from the bench, glaring at
the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Franklin, you are insulting! Leave my premises
this minute and never return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very happy to depart,&rdquo; the man retorted,
smiling coldly. &ldquo;I came here only because you sent
for me. However, if you were inclined to take a sensible
viewpoint, I might make you a business proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Mr. Franklin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to this house here. If you&rsquo;re disposed to sell
it I might make you an offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough had started toward the house, but
then she paused and regarded him speculatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your offer, Mr. Franklin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you fifteen hundred for the house and
grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen hundred!&rdquo; the old lady exclaimed shrilly.
&ldquo;For a house which cost at least forty thousand to
build! Aren&rsquo;t you being outrageously reckless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old houses are a drug on the market these days,
Madam. You&rsquo;ll find no other buyer in Riverview, I
am quite sure. In fact; I wouldn&rsquo;t make you such a
generous offer except that I think this place might be
fixed up as a tourist home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A tourist home!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough cried furiously.
&ldquo;You would make this beautiful, colonial mansion
into a cheap hotel! Oh, go away, and never,
never show your face here again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Madam,&rdquo; Mr. Franklin responded, still
smiling. &ldquo;However, I warn you that my next offer for
the property will not be as generous a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generous!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough fairly screamed for
she was determined to have the final word. &ldquo;Your
price would be robbery! You&rsquo;re just like your father,
who was one of the worst skinflints I ever knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin had nothing more to say. With a
shrug, he turned and strode from the yard. Mrs. Marborough
gazed after him for a moment, and then sinking
down on the stone bench, began to cry. Hearing
footsteps behind her, she turned her head and saw the
three girls. Hastily, she dabbed at her eyes with a lace
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Marborough, don&rsquo;t feel badly,&rdquo; Penny
said quickly. &ldquo;We heard what he said to you. Mr.
Franklin should be ashamed of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man doesn&rsquo;t affect me one way or the other,&rdquo;
the old lady announced with a toss of the head. The
girls accepted the explanation with tranquil faces although
they knew very well why Mrs. Marborough
had wept. Rhoda wandered to the wishing well, peering
down into the crystal-clear water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;m tempted to make another wish,&rdquo;
she remarked. &ldquo;Would it be very selfish of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfish?&rdquo; Louise inquired, puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The last one came true. I shouldn&rsquo;t expect too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do make your wish, Rhoda,&rdquo; urged Penny, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t anticipate quick action. I&rsquo;m still waiting for
mine to come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda drew a bucket of water from the well, and
filling the dipper which always hung on a nail of the
wooden roof, drank deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she said soberly, &ldquo;I wish that Ted might
find a job. If he could get work, maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t
be necessary to accept charity from Mr. Coaten or
anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda&rsquo;s wish, so earnestly spoken, slightly embarrassed
the others, for it served to remind them of the
girl&rsquo;s poverty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you make one, Penny,&rdquo; Louise urged to
cover an awkward silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything I want,&rdquo; Penny answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough announced unexpectedly.
&ldquo;In all the years of my life I&rsquo;ve never made
a wish at this well, but now I shall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the delight of the girls, she reached for the
bucket of water. With a grim face she slammed the
entire contents back into the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little token, O wishing well,&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;My desire is a most worthy one. All I ask is that Jay
Franklin be given his come-uppance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all second that wish!&rdquo; Penny added gaily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough declared, rather pleased
with herself. &ldquo;That makes me feel better. Now I&rsquo;ll
forget that man and go about my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was selfish of him to take the attitude he
did about the stone,&rdquo; Penny said, wishing to keep an
entertaining topic alive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough seemed to have lost all interest in
the subject. Gathering her long skirts about her, she
started for the house. Midway up the flagstone path
she paused to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tree of nice summer apples out yonder by
the back fence. Pick all you like and take some home
if you care for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Marborough,&rdquo; Louise responded
politely.</p>
<p>After the door had closed behind the old lady, the
girls did not immediately leave the vicinity of the
wishing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means to be kind,&rdquo; Louise commented, drawing
figures in the dirt with her shoe. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it
funny she never invites us into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s downright mysterious,&rdquo; Penny added. &ldquo;You
notice Jay Franklin didn&rsquo;t get in there either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does she act that way?&rdquo; Rhoda asked in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny thinks she&rsquo;s trying to keep folks from discovering
something,&rdquo; explained Louise. &ldquo;The old
lady is queer in other ways, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoying the tale, the girls told Rhoda
how they had observed Mrs. Marborough removing
the flagstones surrounding the base of the wishing well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been more digging!&rdquo; Penny suddenly
cried, springing up from the bench. &ldquo;See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excitedly she pointed to a place where additional
flagstones had been lifted and carelessly replaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough must have been at work again!&rdquo;
Louise agreed. &ldquo;What does she expect to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing worms, perhaps,&rdquo; Rhoda suggested with
a smile. &ldquo;Under the flagstones would be a good place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough never would go fishing,&rdquo; Louise
answered. &ldquo;Sometimes I wonder if she&rsquo;s entirely right
in her mind. It just isn&rsquo;t normal to go around digging
on your own property after night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, Mrs. Marborough knows what
she is about,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking for
something which is hidden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can it be?&rdquo; Louise speculated. &ldquo;Nothing
she does seems to make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of the most interesting characters I&rsquo;ve met
in many a day,&rdquo; Penny said warmly. &ldquo;I like her better
all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about those apples?&rdquo; Rhoda suggested,
changing the subject. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Breen could use
some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls started toward the gnarled old tree, a
battered automobile drew up in front of the house.
A man who was dressed in coat and trousers taken
from two separate suits alighted and came briskly up
the walk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Louise whispered curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw him before,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;He
looks almost like a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or an old clothes man,&rdquo; Rhoda added with a laugh.</p>
<p>Observing the girls, the man doffed his battered
derby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this where Mrs. Marborough lives?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is inside,&rdquo; Louise replied.</p>
<p>Bowing again, the man presented himself at the
front door, hammering it loudly with the brass
knocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough will make short work of him,&rdquo;
Penny laughed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so friendly to visitors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the girls could walk on to the apple tree,
Mrs. Marborough opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Butterworth?&rdquo; she asked, without waiting for
the man to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; invited Mrs. Marborough, her voice impersonal.</p>
<p>The caller stepped across the threshold and the door
swung shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; Louise whispered, stunned by
the ease with which the man had gained admittance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did!&rdquo; Penny murmured. &ldquo;That fellow&mdash;whoever
he is&mdash;has accomplished something that
even Riverview&rsquo;s society ladies couldn&rsquo;t achieve!
Maybe I was puzzled before, but now, let me tell you,
I&rsquo;m completely tied in a knot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>A SILKEN LADDER</i></h2>
<p>As Penny approached the school grounds the following
morning, she heard her name called. A moment
later, Rhoda Wiegand, breathless from running,
caught up with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, the most wonderful thing has happened!&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Texas friends have left town?&rdquo; the other
guessed.</p>
<p>Rhoda shook her head. &ldquo;Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not
quite that wonderful. They&rsquo;re still here. This news
is about my brother, Ted. He has a job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s splendid. Exactly what you wished
for yesterday afternoon at the well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange?&rdquo; Rhoda asked
soberly. &ldquo;This makes twice my wish has come true.
How do you account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your brother could have obtained the
job through accident,&rdquo; Penny answered. &ldquo;That
would be the logical explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it all came about in such an unusual way.
Judge Harlan saw Ted on the street and liked his appearance.
So he sent a note to the Camp asking if he
would work as a typist in his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted is accepting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. The pay is splendid for that sort of work.
Besides, it will give him a chance to study law, which
is his life ambition. Oh, Penny, you can&rsquo;t know how
happy I am about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mid-morning recess, Penny reported the conversation
to Louise. Both girls were pleased that Ted
Wiegand had obtained employment, but it did seem
peculiar to them that the judge would go to such
lengths to gain the services of a young man of questionable
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he wants to help him,&rdquo; Louise speculated.
&ldquo;Ted is at the critical point of his life now. He could
develop into a very fine person or just the opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s charity, of course. But who put the judge up
to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough heard Rhoda express her wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; Penny agreed, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
she paid much attention. She was too angry at Jay
Franklin. Besides, Mrs. Marborough doesn&rsquo;t have a
reputation for doing kind deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you rule her out, there&rsquo;s nothing left but the old
wishing well,&rdquo; Louise laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I might be tempted to believe it has unusual powers
if ever it would do anything for me,&rdquo; grumbled Penny.
&ldquo;Not a single one of my wishes has been granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mystery seems to be developing at Rose Acres,&rdquo;
Louise reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not learned anything new since I made my
wish. Mrs. Marborough hasn&rsquo;t decided to cooperate
with the Pilgrimage Committee either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Festival Week program which so interested
Penny had been set for the twentieth of the month and
the days immediately following. Gardens were expected
to be at their height at that time, and the owners
of seven fairly old houses had agreed to open their
doors to the public. Both Penny and Louise had
helped sell tickets for the motor pilgrimage, but sales
resistance was becoming increasingly difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affair may be a big flop,&rdquo; Penny remarked to
her chum. &ldquo;No one wants to pay a dollar to see a
house which isn&rsquo;t particularly interesting. Now Rose
Acres would draw customers. The women of Riverview
are simply torn with curiosity to get in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Marborough ever will change
her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Penny agreed gloomily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Two days elapsed during which nothing happened,
according to the viewpoint of the girls. From Rhoda
they learned that Ted was well established in his new
job, and that Mr. Coaten seemed displeased about it.
Mr. Parker reported that Jay Franklin had made progress
in his efforts to sell the Marborough stone to the
Riverview Museum. Other than that, there was no
news, no developments of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise, let&rsquo;s visit Truman Crocker again,&rdquo; Penny
proposed on Saturday afternoon when time hung
heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would it do?&rdquo; Louise demurred. &ldquo;You
know very well he doesn&rsquo;t like to have us around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted suspicious of us, which made me suspicious
of him. I&rsquo;ve been thinking, Lou&mdash;if the writing
on those two stones were faked, it must have been
done with a chisel&mdash;one which would leave a characteristic
mark. Every tool is slightly different, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which leads you to conclude&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if Truman Crocker did the faking he would
have a tool in his workshop that would make grooves
similar to those on the stones. An expert might compare
them and tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we consider ourselves experts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Penny said impatiently. &ldquo;But if I
could get the right tool, I could turn it over to someone
who knows about such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you propose to go out to the shack today and
appropriate a tool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it from Mr. Crocker. Perhaps I can convince
him I want to chisel a tombstone for myself or
something of the sort!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think you were just plain crazy, Penny
Parker,&rdquo; Louise declared sadly. &ldquo;Lately you&rsquo;ve
reached the stage where adjectives are too weak to
describe you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later found the two girls at the Crocker
shack. The door of the workshop stood open, but as
Penny and Louise peered inside, they saw no sign of
the old stonecutter. A number of tools lay on a bench
where Crocker had been working, and with no hesitation
Penny examined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a chisel,&rdquo; she said in satisfaction. &ldquo;It seems
to be the only one around too. Just what I need!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you wouldn&rsquo;t dare take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my official capacity as a detective&mdash;yes. I&rsquo;ll
leave more than enough money to pay for it. Then
after I&rsquo;ve had it examined by an expert, I&rsquo;ll return it to
Mr. Crocker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mystery, what crimes are committed in thy
name,&rdquo; Louise warbled. &ldquo;If you land in jail, my dear
Penny, don&rsquo;t expect me to share your cell cot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take all the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selecting a bill from her purse, Penny laid it in a
conspicuous place on the workbench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that should buy three or four chisels,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s leave here before Truman
Crocker arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging from the shop, Penny and Louise were
surprised to see dark storm clouds scudding overhead.
The sun had been completely blotted out and occasional
flashes of lightning brightened a gray sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to rain before we can get to Riverview,&rdquo;
Louise declared uneasily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be drenched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go by way of Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;
Penny proposed. &ldquo;Then if the rain does overtake us,
we can dodge into the summer house until the shower
passes over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening toward the hillside trail, the girls observed
that the river level was higher than when last
they had seen it. Muddy water lapped almost at the
doorstep of Truman Crocker&rsquo;s shack. A rowboat tied
to a half submerged dock nearby swung restlessly on
its long rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be afraid to live so close to the river,&rdquo;
Louise remarked. &ldquo;If the water comes only a few feet
higher, Crocker&rsquo;s place will sail South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river control system is supposed to take care
of everything,&rdquo; Penny answered carelessly. &ldquo;Dad
says he doesn&rsquo;t place much faith in it himself&mdash;not if
it&rsquo;s ever put to a severe test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the girls had gone far, a few drops of rain
splattered down. Anticipating a deluge, they ran for
the dilapidated summer house which stood at the rear
edge of Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s property. Completely
winded, they sank down on a dusty wooden bench to
recapture their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clouds are rolling eastward,&rdquo; Louise remarked,
scanning the sky. &ldquo;It may not rain much after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lou!&rdquo; Penny said in a startled voice.</p>
<p>She was gazing toward the old wishing well at a
dark figure which could be seen bending far over the
yawning hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Louise inquired, turning in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over there!&rdquo; Penny directed. &ldquo;Mrs. Marborough
is doing something at the well. Is she trying
to repair it or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s examining the inside!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why, if she&rsquo;s not careful, she may fall. We ought to
warn her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough knows what she is about, Lou.
Let&rsquo;s just watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a distance it was not possible to tell exactly
what the old lady was doing. So far as the girls could
discern she was tapping the inside stones of the well
with a hammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to discover if any of them are loose!&rdquo;
Penny whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Louise, I&rsquo;m sure of it
now! Something of great value is hidden in or near
the wishing well, and Mrs. Marborough came back to
Riverview to find it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s something hidden in or around the well,
why doesn&rsquo;t she have a workman make a thorough
search?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably because she doesn&rsquo;t want folks to suspect
what she is about, Lou. That may explain why she
works at night and on very dark, gloomy days such as
today. She doesn&rsquo;t wish to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough searches in such obvious places,&rdquo;
Louise said after a moment. &ldquo;If anything really is
hidden it might be deep down in the well. She never
will find it in that case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might help her,&rdquo; Penny suggested impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know she would resent our interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably would if we tell her what we intend
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise gazed speculatively at her chum, realizing
that Penny had some plan in mind. She waited expectantly,
and then as the other did not speak, inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what scheme are you hatching now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me the idea yourself,&rdquo; Penny chuckled.
&ldquo;The logical place to search is deep down inside the
well. I&rsquo;m sure the water can&rsquo;t be more than a few feet
deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you want me to dive in and drown myself?&rdquo;
Louise joked. &ldquo;Thank you, but I prefer to restrict my
aquatic exercise to swimming pools!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that silk ladder I acquired when I
helped police capture Al Gepper and his slippery
pals?&rdquo; Penny demanded, paying no heed to the teasing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Louise nodded. &ldquo;It was made of braided
silk strands by a Chinese curio man, and had two iron
hooks to claw into the wood of window ledges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those same hooks will fit very nicely over the side
of the wishing well. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for a chance to
use that ladder, and here it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! You actually have the courage to climb
down into a well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;But it must be tonight
while my enthusiasm is bubbling. Meet me at
nine o&rsquo;clock and bring a good flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise could only stare. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually serious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; Penny replied gaily. &ldquo;Everything is
settled. Now let&rsquo;s slip away from here before Mrs.
Marborough sees us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>NIGHT ADVENTURE</i></h2>
<p>The night, dark and misty, was entirely suitable
for the purpose to which the two girls had dedicated it.
Dinner over, Penny obtained the unique silken ladder
from an attic trunk. Compressing it into a small brief-case,
she sauntered through the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you becoming quite studious of late?&rdquo; Mr.
Parker inquired, noting the brief-case tucked under
her arm. &ldquo;Off to the library again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to Louise&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Penny corrected vaguely.
&ldquo;From that point on there&rsquo;s no guarantee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be home early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Penny answered earnestly. &ldquo;If for any
reason I fail to appear, don&rsquo;t search in any of the obvious
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving her father to ponder over the remark, she
hastily quitted the house. A clock chimed nine
o&rsquo;clock as she reached the Sidell house, and a moment
later her chum joined her in the yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had trouble getting away,&rdquo; Louise reported.
&ldquo;Mother asked a thousand questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bring the flashlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here it is. My, but it&rsquo;s a dark night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better for our purpose,&rdquo; Penny said cheerfully.</p>
<p>A single light burned in the kitchen window of the
Marborough house as the girls presently approached
it. The garden was shrouded in damp, wispy mist and
the unkempt grounds never had appeared more desolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, must we go through with this?&rdquo; Louise
asked, rapidly losing enthusiasm for the venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit the idea doesn&rsquo;t look quite as attractive as
it did this afternoon,&rdquo; her chum replied. &ldquo;All the
same, I&rsquo;m going through with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you hope to find down in that well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not answer. Walking ahead of Louise,
she noiselessly crossed the yard to the old wishing well.
Flashing her light into the circular interior, her courage
nearly failed her. However, she gave no indication
of it to her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be careful of that light,&rdquo; Louise warned.
&ldquo;That is, unless you want Mrs. Marborough to come
out and catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny switched off the flashlight and thereafter
worked in darkness. Taking the silken ladder from
its case, she fastened the two iron hooks over the stone
ledge. Next, she lowered the ladder into the well,
listening until she heard a faint splash in the water below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you stay here and keep watch,&rdquo; she instructed
briskly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down and back again before
you know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ladder may break,&rdquo; Louise said pessimistically,
seating herself on the stone ledge of the well. &ldquo;Silk
deteriorates with age, and those braided strands never
did look strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They once held one of Riverview&rsquo;s most notorious
apartment-house burglars,&rdquo; Penny returned with
forced cheerfulness. She climbed over the ledge, gazing
down into the dark well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe enough&mdash;I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case you slip and fall, just what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your problem,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;Now
hand me the flashlight. I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite their banter, both girls were tense and worried.
By daylight, a descent into the well had seemed
to Penny an amusing stunt; but now as she cautiously
descended into the damp, circular pit, she felt that for
once in her life she had ventured too far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Louise called softly from
above. &ldquo;Anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reminded of the work before her, Penny clung
with one hand to the swaying ladder, while with the
other she directed the flashlight beam about the circular
walls. The sides were cracked in many places and
covered with a slimy green moss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see, Penny?&rdquo; Louise called again.
&ldquo;Are any of the bricks loose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I can discover,&rdquo; Penny answered, and her
voice echoed weirdly. Intrigued by the sound she
tried an experimental yodel. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just like a
cave scene on the radio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case you&rsquo;ve forgotten, you&rsquo;re in a well,&rdquo; Louise
said severely. &ldquo;Furthermore, if you don&rsquo;t work fast,
Mrs. Marborough will come out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to have a little relaxation,&rdquo; Penny grumbled.</p>
<p>Descending deeper into the well, she resumed her
task of examining the walls. There were no loose
bricks, nothing to indicate that anything ever had been
hidden in the cavern. Reaching the last rung without
realizing it, she stepped not into space, but water.</p>
<p>Surprisingly her foot struck a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Hastily pulling herself back on the ladder, Penny
shouted the information to her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, the water isn&rsquo;t more than a foot and a half
deep! There&rsquo;s an old boot or something of the sort
floating around. You don&rsquo;t catch me drinking any
more of this water. No sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; Penny called, flashing her light upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; came the whispered response. &ldquo;I think
someone is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough?&rdquo; Penny gasped, thoroughly
alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Two men! They&rsquo;re turning in at the gate!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Penny began to climb the silken ladder with frantic
haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can get out without them seeing you!&rdquo;
Louise hissed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ducking out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see me if I don&rsquo;t. Stay where you are
Penny, and I&rsquo;ll come back after they go. Oh, the ladder!
It&rsquo;s sure to give you away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the emergency, Penny&rsquo;s mind worked with rapidity.
Lowering herself into the well several rungs, she
deliberately stepped into the water. To her relief it
came just below her knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Pull up the ladder!&rdquo; she instructed.</p>
<p>The two men were so close that Louise dared not
obey. Instead she loosed the iron hooks and dropped
the ladder into the well. Penny barely was able to
catch it and prevent a loud splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the tricks&mdash;&rdquo; she muttered, but Louise did
not hear. She had fled into a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>Penny huddled against the slimy wall, listening
intently. Thinking that she heard footsteps, she
switched out the flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place all right,&rdquo; a masculine voice said.
&ldquo;Wonder if the old lady is at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light showing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices faded away, and Penny drew a deep sigh
of relief. Impatiently she waited for Louise to come
to her aid. After several minutes she realized why her
chum delayed, for she again heard voices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old lady must be inside the house. Funny she
wouldn&rsquo;t come to the door. They say she&rsquo;s a queer
one though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny&rsquo;s discomfort, the two men paused by the
wishing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a drink?&rdquo; she heard one ask.</p>
<p>The voices seemed faintly familiar to Penny and
suddenly it dawned upon her that the two men were
Mr. Coaten and his Texas friend. However, she could
think of no reason why they should call upon Mrs.
Marborough. Her reflection came to an abrupt end,
as the well bucket splashed into the water beside her.</p>
<p>Suppressing a giggle, she groped for the old boot
which floated nearby. Dropping it into the bucket,
she watched as it was raised to the surface. A moment
later she heard an exclamation of wrath from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I&rsquo;ve drawn up!&rdquo; one of the men muttered.
&ldquo;These old wells must be filled with filth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hoped that the strangers would immediately
depart, but instead they loitered by the well, talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been wasting entirely too much time in
this,&rdquo; remarked the man whom she took to be Mr.
Coaten. &ldquo;Suppose we were to offer Ted a hundred
dollars to sign the paper. Would he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he might, but the girl is the one who&rsquo;ll make
trouble. She&rsquo;s shrewd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get around her somehow,&rdquo; the other said
gruffly. &ldquo;This thing can&rsquo;t drag on forever. I have
work waiting for me in Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The voices gradually died away and Penny heard no
more. However, from the snatch of conversation, she
was convinced that Rhoda&rsquo;s suspicions regarding the
Texas strangers had been well founded. But what had
brought the two men to Riverview?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Rhoda or Ted own property, I could understand
why it would be desirable to adopt them,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;As it is, the thing doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To keep from freezing, Penny gingerly waded
around and around in the well. It seemed ages before
Louise thrust her head over the ledge and called softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still there, pet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frozen into one big icicle!&rdquo; Penny retorted.
&ldquo;Get me out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instructing her chum to lower the bucket, Penny
fastened the silken ladder to the handle. Louise hauled
it up, and again hooked the irons to the ledge of the
well.</p>
<p>Stiffly, Penny climbed toward the surface. She had
nearly reached the top when the beam of light chanced
to play across a section of brick which hitherto had escaped
her notice. Halting, she traced with her finger
a rectangular pattern on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an ordinary crack!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It
might be an old opening which has been bricked up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo; Louise called impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Penny, emerging from the well. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t you dare say that this night has been a failure.
I&rsquo;ve just made a most astounding discovery!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>OLD BOTTLES</i></h2>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s startling appearance rather than her
words made the deepest impression upon Louise. The
girl&rsquo;s shoes and stockings were wet, her clothing was
smeared with green slime, and strings of moss clung to
her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like Father Neptune emerging from the
briny deep,&rdquo; she chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m freezing to death,&rdquo; Penny chattered. &ldquo;Come
on, we&rsquo;re going home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise hauled up the silken ladder from the well.
Squeezing out the water, she compressed it into the
carrying case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you saying about a discovery?&rdquo; she inquired
belatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing of consequence,&rdquo; Penny answered,
pounding her hands together to restore circulation.
&ldquo;Merely an opening in the side of the well. It probably
leads into a tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of anything except that I&rsquo;m going
home!&rdquo; Penny replied crossly.</p>
<p>She started across the lawn with her chum hurrying
after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, I&rsquo;m terribly sorry,&rdquo; Louise said contritely.
&ldquo;I know you had an awful time down in the
well. But it wasn&rsquo;t my fault those two men arrived
just when they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo; Penny asked, mollified by the
apology. &ldquo;From their voices I took them to be Mr.
Coaten and his friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who they were. But, I can&rsquo;t imagine why
they came to see Mrs. Marborough. Anyway, they
didn&rsquo;t get into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, I heard those men talking while I was down
in the well,&rdquo; Penny revealed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re dishonest.
They want Ted and Rhoda to sign something
over to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Rhoda said she and her brother have no property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Penny frowned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make head nor
tail of the situation. I&rsquo;m too miserable to think about
anything now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing beside a tree, she removed one of her shoes.
After pouring a little water from it, she replaced it and
went through a similar procedure with the other shoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me what else you learned while in the
well,&rdquo; Louise pleaded. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been punished
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her good humor restored, Penny grinned amiably.
&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Lou, I&rsquo;m not sure whether I
found anything or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Just as I reached the top of the well I
noticed a section of brick wall which seemed to be
cracked in the exact shape of a rectangle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; Louise asked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even take time to examine the place. I felt
so disgusted,&rdquo; Penny resumed. &ldquo;However, I believe
that if one were able to remove those loose bricks, an
opening might be found behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where something may be hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could one remove the bricks without hiring
a workman?&rdquo; Louise asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are as loose as I think they are, I might be
able to get them out myself. Not tonight though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny felt in no mood to discuss future possibilities
or even to consider them. Already cold, the misty air
added to her physical discomfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get a hot shower and go to bed,&rdquo; Louise advised
as they finally reached the Parker home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
talk things over in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Not desiring to attract attention to herself, Penny
entered the house by a side door. To her discomfiture,
Mrs. Weems, who chanced to be getting a drink in the
kitchen, saw the disheveled clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Penny Parker!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What have
you done to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Penny mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a little wet.
I&rsquo;ve been down in a well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are times when your jokes don&rsquo;t seem at all
funny,&rdquo; the housekeeper said sternly. &ldquo;How did you
ruin your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth, Mrs. Weems. I was down in a
well and I stepped off into the water&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you can&rsquo;t expect me to believe such a tall
story. Now tell me exactly what <i>did</i> happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it seem more reasonable if I said that I stumbled
and fell into a ditch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather thought something of the sort happened,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems declared. &ldquo;How did the accident
occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny maintained plaintively.</p>
<p>Escaping upstairs before the housekeeper could
question her further, she took a hot shower and went
to bed. She could hear a murmur of voices in the living
room below, and knew that Mrs. Weems was discussing
her &ldquo;behavior&rdquo; with her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes grownups are so unreasonable,&rdquo; she
sighed, snuggling into the covers. &ldquo;You tell them
the truth and what they really want is a nice logical
whopper!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Penny slept soundly and did not awaken until the
Sunday morning sun was high in the heavens. Sitting
up in bed, she moved her arms experimentally. They
were very sore and stiff. She swung her feet to the
floor and groaned with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I can&rsquo;t take it any more,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I
must be getting soft, or else it&rsquo;s old age sneaking up
on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Torturing herself with a limbering exercise, Penny
dressed and went downstairs. Mrs. Weems had gone
to church while Mr. Parker had submerged himself in
fifty-eight pages of Sunday paper. Detouring around
the living room, Penny went to the kitchen to prepare
herself a belated breakfast. She was picking at the
nuts of a fruit salad found in the ice box when her
father appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny&mdash;&rdquo; he began sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was I last night?&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
said before, and now repeat&mdash;in a well! A nice deep
one with water in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re ready to tell me the real story, I shall
listen,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said quietly. &ldquo;Until that time, I
must deprive you of your weekly allowance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo; Penny wailed. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m stony
broke! I won&rsquo;t be able to drive my car or even buy a
hot dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your misfortune. Mrs. Weems says I have
been entirely too indulgent with you, and I am inclined
to agree with her. I&rsquo;ve seldom checked your
comings or goings, but in the future I shall expect you
to tell me your plans when you leave the house at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Having delivered his ultimatum, Mr. Parker quietly
withdrew.</p>
<p>Penny had lost her appetite for breakfast. Feeling
much abused she banged out the kitchen door into the
yard. Her first act was to inspect the gasoline tanks
of both Leaping Lena and the maroon car. As she had
feared, the combined fuel supply did not equal three
gallons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just about fifty-five miles between me and
misery,&rdquo; she reflected grimly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare siphon
gas out of Dad&rsquo;s car or ask for credit at a filling station
either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wandering around to the front porch, she sat down
on the steps. One of her high school boy friends pedalled
past on his bicycle, calling a cheery greeting.
Penny barely responded.</p>
<p>Presently a milk wagon clattered to a stop in front
of the house. The driver came up the walk with his
rack of milk bottles. Penny eyed him speculatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a lot of old bottles in the basement,&rdquo; she
greeted him. &ldquo;Does your company pay for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he declined. &ldquo;We use only our own
stamped bottles. There&rsquo;s no deposit charge. Customers
are expected to return them without rebate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver left a quart of milk on the back doorstep
of the Parker home. In walking to his wagon, he
paused beside Penny, remarking:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you could sell your old bottles to a second-hand
dealer. I saw one on the next street about five
minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Penny demanded, jumping to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was on Fulton Avenue when I drove past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the driver, Penny ran as fast as her stiff
limbs would permit to the next street corner. Far up
the avenue she saw a battered old car of the second-hand
man. Hurrying on, she reached the automobile
just as its owner came from a house carrying an armful
of corded newspapers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she called eagerly, &ldquo;do you buy old
bottles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man turned toward her, doffing his derby hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I buy newspapers,
old furniture, rubber tires, copper, brass, or gold, but
not bottles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny scarcely heard the discouraging information
for she was staring at the man as if his appearance fascinated
her. For a moment she could not think where
she had seen him before. And then suddenly she remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I saw you at Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s place!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one person who has been inside
the house! I want you to tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>INSIDE THE MANSION</i></h2>
<p>Mr. Butterworth, the second-hand dealer,
scarcely knew what to make of Penny&rsquo;s abrupt request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how the house looks inside,&rdquo; she requested
as he remained mute. &ldquo;Is it as handsome as folks say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a friend of Mrs. Marborough?&rdquo; the man
inquired, cocking his head sideways as he regarded the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you not ask Mrs. Marborough that
question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she never invites anyone into her house,&rdquo;
Penny explained patiently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only person
to get in so far as I know. I&rsquo;ll venture she sold you
something. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Mr. Butterworth grinned. &ldquo;My lips,
they are sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sealed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise Mrs. Marborough I tell nothing of what
I see in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is something mysterious going on
there!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;Tell me, why did you go
to the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough sent for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Penny demanded, exasperated because
she could learn nothing of importance. &ldquo;Did Mrs.
Marborough sell you something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, maybe not,&rdquo; the second-hand man answered,
climbing into his overloaded car. &ldquo;You ask
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny watched him drive away, and then returned
to her own doorstep. She was listlessly throwing
acorns at a squirrel when Louise Sidell came down the
street, dressed in her Sunday best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Penny?&rdquo; she inquired, roving
over to the porch. &ldquo;How do you feel this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower than the center of the earth. I&rsquo;ve lost my
reputation with Dad, my allowance, and my initiative.
If I had a nickel I&rsquo;d go drown myself in a coke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you need is a nice adventure,&rdquo; Louise said
mischievously. &ldquo;How about a trip out to Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
tomorrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of wells!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; Louise grinned.
&ldquo;After discovering those loose bricks, you&rsquo;ll just forget
about them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Penny demanded wildly. &ldquo;Dad won&rsquo;t
let me leave the house at night any more without a six
thousand page report on where I am going. If I so
much as mention Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s well, he&rsquo;ll clap on
a double punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can manage it somehow,&rdquo; Louise declared
with confidence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you tomorrow night about
eight-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Penny said gloomily.</p>
<p>Throughout the day she tried to win favor with
both Mrs. Weems and her father by doing small things
to please them. When the housekeeper came home
from church, dinner awaited her. Penny insisted upon
doing the dishes. She straightened the kitchen, she
brought her father his bedroom slippers, and refrained
from turning on the radio while he was reading. The
schedule was a trying one for her, but she kept it up
faithfully all day Sunday and until after dinner on
Monday. Then came the denouement upon which
she pinned her hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she said demurely, leaning on the chair arm
and stroking his hair, &ldquo;with your kind permission I
should like to absent myself from the house for a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you plan to go?&rdquo; he asked, trying to act
stern.</p>
<p>Penny was prepared for the question. From her
pocket she whisked a lengthy typewritten paper, handsomely
decorated with a diagram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked, his lips twitching
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely a report on my proposed movements for
the next hour. At eight-thirty I hope to be at Louise&rsquo;s
house. Eight thirty-four should find me on Adams
Street, moving southward. At eight thirty-eight I pass
Gulbert Park&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Mr. Parker interrupted. &ldquo;I see by
this lengthy document that your ultimate destination
is Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s estate. Isn&rsquo;t it rather late to pay
a social call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-thirty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this X on the map represent?&rdquo; the publisher
asked, his interest shifting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that?&rdquo; smiled Penny. &ldquo;Merely one of the fixtures
in Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s yard. Louise and I think
treasure may be hidden there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amused by what he took to be his daughter&rsquo;s
whimsy, Mr. Parker returned the diagram to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I have your permission to leave the house?&rdquo; she
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may go,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But mind, no late
hours. And no more tall tales about falling into wells!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise was waiting for Penny in the Sidell yard and
the girls went as quickly as they could to the Marborough
estate. The house was completely dark, leading
them to believe that the widow might have absented
herself for the evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be especially careful,&rdquo; Louise warned
as they approached the old wishing well. &ldquo;She might
return at any moment and find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had brought the silken ladder, extra rope, a
flashlight and a suit of warm coveralls which her father
used when he worked on the car. Donning the bulky
garment, she prepared to descend a few feet into the
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be careful,&rdquo; Louise said anxiously. &ldquo;If you
should fall you might kill yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think of the most cheerful things,&rdquo; Penny
muttered, climbing nimbly down the swaying ladder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not taking any chances though. I&rsquo;ll tie myself to
the ladder with this extra piece of rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had gained the position she desired, Louise
handed down the flashlight. Penny carefully inspected
the brick wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is an opening!&rdquo; she reported jubilantly.
&ldquo;I really do. Here, take this flash. I can&rsquo;t work and
hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Louise directed the beam from above, Penny
tugged at the bricks. Unable to move them, she called
for a tool which she had brought with her. By means
of it, she easily pried one of the bricks loose. Pushing
her arm through the opening, she encountered only
empty space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little tunnel I think!&rdquo; she shouted to Louise.
&ldquo;Take this brick, and I&rsquo;ll try to pry out others!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Within ten minutes Penny had handed up enough
of them to make a large pile beside the flagstones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize you&rsquo;re practically destroying Mrs.
Marborough&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; Louise said uneasily. &ldquo;How will
we ever explain this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can put the bricks back again,&rdquo; Penny assured
her. &ldquo;They were meant to come out. Now, the flashlight
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Balancing herself precariously on the ladder, she directed
the light through the opening she had created.
A long narrow tunnel which she judged to be about
five feet below the ground, extended as far as she
could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to get in there!&rdquo; she called to Louise.
&ldquo;Toss me a life preserver if I fail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calculating the space, Penny swung her feet from
the ladder to the ledge. Retaining an arm hold on the
ropes, she edged herself backwards into the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much easier than it looks,&rdquo; she called encouragingly
to her chum. &ldquo;Come on, if you want to explore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise hesitated, and then daringly climbed down
into the well. Penny helped her from the ladder into
the tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose this leads?&rdquo; Louise gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe to the house,&rdquo; Penny speculated. &ldquo;I know
lots of these old places had escapes made so that in
time of war or Indian attacks, the householders could
get away. Never heard of a tunnel opening into a well
though!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The bricked passageway was so low that for the first
twelve feet the girls were forced to crawl on hands
and knees. Gradually, the tunnel deepened until they
were able to walk in a stooped position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to the end of it,&rdquo; Penny presently
announced.</p>
<p>Directly in front of her was a heavy door which
showed the effects of age. It did not move easily, but
together, the girls were able to swing it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world are we?&rdquo; Louise murmured in
perplexity.</p>
<p>Penny flashed her light directly ahead. A series of
four steps led down from the tunnel into an empty
room which barely was six feet across. So far as she
could see it had no exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we&rsquo;re at the end of the trail,&rdquo; Louise
remarked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be part of the Marborough house,&rdquo;
Penny declared, descending the steps into the tiny
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no way out of it except through the
tunnel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be if we can find it,&rdquo; Penny insisted.</p>
<p>Wandering about the room she began to explore the
walls, and Louise followed her example. Their search
was rewarded, for presently they discovered a small
brass knob embedded in the rough board paneling.
Penny pulled on it and a section of wall slid back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re really in the Marborough house!&rdquo;
she whispered excitedly. &ldquo;The basement, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping through the opening, the girls made no
sound as they tiptoed around in the dark, damp room.
Penny&rsquo;s flashlight revealed that the walls had been
boarded over, but there was no solid foundation beneath
their feet, only a hard dirt floor. A steep stairway
led up from the basement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Mrs. Marborough is here?&rdquo; Penny
whispered, listening.</p>
<p>There was no sound from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go upstairs, or back the way we came?&rdquo;
she asked her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s risk being caught,&rdquo; Louise decided after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be sent to jail for
house breaking than to climb into that well again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddling together, the girls crept up the stairway.
The landing was blocked by another door. Penny
tested it, and finding it unlocked, pushed it gently
open. Again they listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast is clear,&rdquo; Louise whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
Mrs. Marborough isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stepped across the threshold, tense with anticipation.
Ever since Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s arrival in
Riverview she had longed to see the interior of the
grand old mansion. And now, through a strange quirk
of adventure, her ambition was to be gratified.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Slowly she allowed the flashlight beam to play over
the walls of the room. There were several pictures in
massive gold frames, leading her to think that she had
entered a library or living room. Systematically, she
continued to move the light about in search of furniture.
So far as she could see there was none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room is empty!&rdquo; Louise whispered at her
elbow.</p>
<p>A board squeaked beneath their weight as the girls
tiptoed to a doorway opening into a still larger room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the living room,&rdquo; Penny decided, observing
a beautiful, circular stairway which rose to the
second floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the furniture?&rdquo; demanded Louise in
bewilderment.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s light cut squares across the room, but the
only objects revealed were a chair and a table drawn
close to the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; Louise gasped. &ldquo;The house
always has been furnished. Now everything is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not answer. The sound of shuffling feet
on the front porch caused both girls to freeze against
the wall. Before they could retreat to the basement
stairs, the living room door opened. Light from a
street lamp cut a path across the bare floor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough stood framed in the doorway.
The girls had made no sound, yet the mistress of Rose
Acres seemed to sense that she was not alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she called sharply. &ldquo;Speak up! Who
is hiding here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>THE MARBOROUGH PEARLS</i></h2>
<p>In frightened voices Penny and Louise acknowledged
their presence in the dark room. Greatly
relieved that the intruders were girls, Mrs. Marborough
struck a match and lighted three half-burned
candles which were set in a huge glass candelabra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she exclaimed as the flickering
light fell upon their faces. &ldquo;May I ask why you have
broken into my house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thoroughly ashamed of ourselves, Mrs. Marborough,&rdquo;
Penny said apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we are,&rdquo; added Louise. &ldquo;When we started
to investigate the wishing well we didn&rsquo;t intend to enter
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you explain,&rdquo; suggested the mistress of
Rose Acres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;May we sit
down somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The request embarrassed Mrs. Marborough. She
hesitated, and then indicated that the girls were to follow
her. To their surprise she led them through
another empty room to the kitchen, there lighting a
candle. Its soft illumination revealed an old oil stove,
several chairs, a porcelain table and a cot which obviously
served both as a day couch and bed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough offered no explanation or apology.
Taking wood from a box, she piled it into the
fireplace, and soon had a cheerful blaze on the hearth.</p>
<p>Drawing their chairs to the fire, Penny and Louise
explained how they had entered the old mansion. Mrs.
Marborough listened attentively to their story but did
not appear especially surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known about that old tunnel,&rdquo; she said
when they had finished. &ldquo;It was built by the first
owner of this house, many, many years ago, and I
doubt if it ever was used. I tried to find the entrance
from the basement a few days ago, but was unable to
locate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw you with your lantern at the wishing
well,&rdquo; Louise confessed. &ldquo;That was what aroused our
curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for the other tunnel entrance. I
found it without much trouble, but it was so deep
down in the well that I dared not risk trying to get
into it. Although I considered hiring a man, I hesitated,
because I knew it would cause talk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Penny and Louise were feeling much more at ease,
sensing that the mistress of Rose Acres no longer was
irritated by their actions. Eagerly they waited for her
to reveal more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think me a queer old lady,&rdquo; Mrs.
Marborough resumed. &ldquo;Perhaps I am, but I have a
very good reason for some of the things I do. I came
to Riverview to search for something which has been
lost many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something hidden during the Civil War?&rdquo; inquired
Louise breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, an object secreted by my sister, Virginia.
Since you girls already have learned so much
I will tell you all. Perhaps you have heard of the Marborough
pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget that you are so very young,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
said. &ldquo;Your mothers would remember. At
any rate, the necklace was handed down in our family
for many generations, always to the daughter who was
the first to marry. Virginia, my younger sister,
dreamed and hoped that the pearls would go to her.
Naturally, I shared a similar desire. As it came about,
I was the first of the family to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you received the necklace?&rdquo; Louise commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should have gone to me, but my sister was determined
I never should win such a victory over her. In
a fit of anger she hid the pearls. Father tried to force
her to tell what she had done with them, but she was
very headstrong. She ran away from home, married
a scamp, and sailed with him to South America. She
died there less than two years after my own marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the pearls?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our family believed that she took the necklace
with her. For many years we assumed that Virginia&rsquo;s
worthless husband had obtained possession of it. He
denied any knowledge of the pearls, but we never accepted
his story as true. Then, a few weeks ago, a
letter came from South America. It had been written
by Virginia&rsquo;s husband shortly before his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He confessed to the theft of the necklace?&rdquo; Louise
asked, trying to speed the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. He merely enclosed a letter written
by Virginia years before. It was addressed to me, and
had never been sent, because her husband deliberately
withheld it. Just selfish and cantankerous, that man
was! The letter told where the pearls had been hidden.
I imagine that Virginia&rsquo;s husband had planned to
gain possession of them someday, but fate defeated
him. So on his death bed he sent me the original letter
which I should have received forty years earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were the pearls hidden?&rdquo; Penny questioned,
her eyes sparkling with anticipation. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
found them yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I doubt that I ever shall,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
sighed. &ldquo;Virginia&rsquo;s letter was not very definite.
She begged my forgiveness for having caused so much
trouble, and said that she had hidden the necklace near
the old wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she tell you where?&rdquo; Louise asked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were several words which had been blotted
with ink. I suspect Virginia&rsquo;s husband did it to prevent
anyone but himself from learning the hiding
place. Then when he finally sent the letter to me, he
may have forgotten what he had done. That&rsquo;s only
my guess, of course. As the letter reads, my only clue
is that the pearls were hidden near the wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains why you were removing the flagstones
the other night,&rdquo; Louise remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve searched everywhere I can think of except
in the old tunnel. When you girls went through
it tonight, did you notice anything unusual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hiding place,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;Of course we
weren&rsquo;t looking for anything of the sort. If we could
explore the passageway by daylight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we help you find the pearls, Mrs. Marborough?&rdquo;
Louise interrupted. &ldquo;It would be such fun
searching for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very happy to have your help,&rdquo; the old lady
said, smiling. &ldquo;Upon one condition. You must tell
no one. Already I am the laughing stock of Riverview
and if this latest story should get around everyone
would talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise promptly assured her that they
would tell no one about the pearls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough hesitated and
then went on. &ldquo;I suppose you understand now why
I never invited you into the house. It wasn&rsquo;t that I
meant to be inhospitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the place isn&rsquo;t fixed up?&rdquo; Louise came to
her aid. &ldquo;Why, Penny and I would have thought
nothing of it. This is a cozy kitchen with a cheerful
fire. I think it&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I probably shan&rsquo;t be here long. My purpose in returning
to Riverview was to find the pearls. I&rsquo;ve
nearly made up my mind that they are lost forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;Tomorrow,
with your permission, Louise and I will explore the
tunnel. We may have luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to have your help, my dear.&rdquo;
Again Mrs. Marborough groped for words and finished
awkwardly: &ldquo;Please, I beg of you, don&rsquo;t tell
anyone what you have seen tonight, particularly the
barren state of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; Penny said gravely.</p>
<p>The fire had burned low. Mindful that they must
be home early, the girls bade Mrs. Marborough goodbye,
promising to return the following day. Once outside
the mansion, they paused beside a tree so that
Penny might remove the heavy coveralls which she
still wore over her frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a night!&rdquo; she murmured happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For once, Penny, one of your crazy adventures
turned out beautifully,&rdquo; Louise praised. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
a wonderful time searching for that necklace! She&rsquo;s
certainly queer though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, imagine being so sensitive about how the interior
of her house looks. Who would expect it to be
fixed up nicely after standing empty so many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting something?&rdquo; Penny asked.
She hopped grotesquely on one foot as she extricated
the other from the coveralls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgetting what?&rdquo; Louise demanded, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that first day we peeped into the house
through the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, what about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your memory isn&rsquo;t very good, Louise. Don&rsquo;t you
remember the sheet-draped furniture we saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I had forgotten. What became
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had just one guess, I&rsquo;d say&mdash;Mr. Butterworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A second-hand dealer who buys old furniture,
newspapers, rubber tires&mdash;everything except bottles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that funny looking man we saw enter this
house the other day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same. Louise, it&rsquo;s my guess that Mrs. Marborough
sold all of her valuable antiques&mdash;probably
for a fraction of their true worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish of her. Why would she do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; Penny asked patiently.
&ldquo;There can be but one explanation. Mrs. Marborough
isn&rsquo;t wealthy any more. She&rsquo;s living in dire poverty
and trying to keep people from learning the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>SIGNBOARD INDIANS</i></h2>
<p>The realization that in all likelihood Mrs. Marborough
had sold her valuable antiques to the second-hand
dealer was disconcerting to Louise as well as
Penny. They did not believe that Mr. Butterworth
would pay a fractional part of the furniture&rsquo;s true
value, and apparently the widow&rsquo;s only reason for
parting with her treasures was an urgent need for
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I may have guessed wrong about it,&rdquo;
Penny admitted as she and Louise started toward home.
&ldquo;Just to check up, I&rsquo;ll call at Mr. Butterworth&rsquo;s shop
tomorrow and see what I can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we dared tell someone about the condition
of the house,&rdquo; Louise said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Why, if
Mrs. Marborough is in need, Mother would help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;But we
gave our promise not to reveal anything we saw. For
the time-being, our hands are tied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>The events of the night had made the girls eager to
return again to Rose Acres to search for the missing
pearl necklace. They agreed that immediately after
school the next afternoon they would call upon Mr.
Butterworth and then keep their appointment with the
widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, we mustn&rsquo;t tell anyone what we have
learned,&rdquo; Penny warned as she parted company with
her chum. &ldquo;Not even Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the following day, both girls were so
excited that they found it all but impossible to study.
When the closing bell finally brought release, they
bolted from the school building before any of their
classmates could detain them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the address of Mr. Butterworth&rsquo;s shop,&rdquo;
Penny said, consulting a paper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building proved to be a typical second-hand
store with old tables and chairs piled in the windows
along with cut glass and bric-a-brac. Entering, the
girls wandered about until a woman asked them if they
were searching for anything in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested in furniture,&rdquo; Penny explained.
&ldquo;Old pieces&mdash;antiques if we can find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the back room,&rdquo; the woman invited.
&ldquo;Mr. Butterworth bought a number of pieces just a
few days ago. From one of Riverview&rsquo;s best homes
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; inquired Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear him mention the name. It was from
a house that has been closed many years. The owner
returned only a short time ago and is closing out everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls did not doubt that the furniture under discussion
had been obtained from Rose Acres. They
were certain of it as they viewed rosewood and mahogany
chairs, imported mirrors, porcelain ornaments,
massive four-poster beds, sofas with damaged coverings,
and handsome chests and bureaus. Penny ventured
to price a few of the items. The amount asked
was so low that she knew Mr. Butterworth had paid
an extremely small sum to the widow. Making an excuse
for not purchasing, she and Louise escaped to the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question about it,&rdquo; Penny declared as
they set off for Rose Acres. &ldquo;Mrs. Marborough sold
her beautiful things to Mr. Butterworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t appreciate their value or he never would
offer them at such low prices,&rdquo; Louise added. &ldquo;Anyone
who buys those things will obtain wonderful bargains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded soberly. Lost in thought, she had
little to say until the girls drew near Rose Acres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let on to Mrs. Marborough that we&rsquo;ve learned
about the furniture,&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really none of
our affair if she sells her belongings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The widow had been expecting the girls and had
everything in readiness to explore the tunnel. While
they searched it from end to end, she waited hopefully
at the wishing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found anything?&rdquo; she called several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Penny would reply patiently.</p>
<p>She and Louise laboriously examined every inch of
the bricked passageway but with fading hope. The
walls were firm, giving no indication that anything
ever had been hidden behind or within them. To have
excavated the hard-packed dirt flooring was a task not
to be considered at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here,&rdquo; Penny whispered to her
chum. &ldquo;I doubt that the pearls ever were hidden in
this tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough will be terribly disappointed,&rdquo;
Louise replied in an undertone. &ldquo;What shall we tell
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can pretend to keep on searching. Maybe if
we prowl about this place for a few days, we&rsquo;ll have
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pearls were hidden near the wishing well. We
have that much to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have disappeared years ago,&rdquo; Penny
contributed pessimistically. &ldquo;To tell you the truth,
I don&rsquo;t feel very hopeful about ever finding them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Leaving the tunnel by means of the easier exit, the
girls emerged into the basement. They were preparing
to climb the stairs to the first floor when Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
voice reached their ears almost as plainly as
if she were in the cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise! Penny! Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled by the clearness of the call, the girls paused
on the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, her voice came through as plainly as if she
were in this room!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
suppose Mrs. Marborough has ventured into the passageway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoroughly alarmed, the girls raced up the stairway
and out of the house into the yard. To their relief
they saw Mrs. Marborough standing by the wishing
well, peering anxiously down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo; she murmured as they ran up.
&ldquo;I was beginning to get worried. The last time I
called you did not answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were down in the basement,&rdquo; Penny explained.
&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough, your voice came through to us as
plainly as if you were in the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disclosure did not seem to surprise the widow,
for she smiled and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known that sound carried from the well
to the house. In fact, in past years I found it amusing
to listen to conversations carried on by persons who
never dreamed that their words were overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that explains why so many wishes which
were made here at the well came true!&rdquo; Penny cried.
&ldquo;You were the Good Fairy behind it all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now and then, if it pleased my fancy, I arranged
to have a wish granted,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
acknowledged, smiling grimly. &ldquo;That was in the days
when I had money&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off and ended&mdash;&ldquo;more
than I have now, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough, you must have heard those
wishes we made the day of your return to Riverview,&rdquo;
Penny said after a moment. &ldquo;Were you responsible
for sending a basket of food to Rhoda&rsquo;s people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you grant Rhoda&rsquo;s second wish?&rdquo; Louise
asked quickly. &ldquo;Did you have anything to do with
getting her brother, Ted, a job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge Harlan is an old friend of mine,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
explained. &ldquo;I merely wrote him a note suggesting
that he would do me a favor by helping the
boy if he found him worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the widow&rsquo;s admission cleared up much
of the mystery which had surrounded the old wishing
well, Louise and Penny were dumbfounded, nevertheless.
Never once had anyone in Riverview connected
Mrs. Marborough with a particularly charitable
deed.</p>
<p>As if guessing their thoughts, the woman said
sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now mind, I&rsquo;ll not have you telling this around the
town! I&rsquo;m through with all such silly business, and I
don&rsquo;t propose to have busybodies discuss whether or
not I am addle-brained!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Marborough!&rdquo; protested Louise. &ldquo;It
was a kind, generous thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generous, fiddlesticks! I did it because it pleased
me and for no other reason. Let&rsquo;s not talk about it
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough questioned the girls concerning
their exploration of the tunnel. Her disappointment
over the failure to find the pearls was keen but she
tried not to show it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it was a fool&rsquo;s errand coming to Riverview
to look for that stupid necklace!&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Like as not, it never was hidden at Rose Acres, my
sister&rsquo;s letter to the contrary. I intend to forget about
the whole affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Marborough, don&rsquo;t give up so soon,&rdquo;
Penny pleaded. &ldquo;Louise and I have only started to
search. We may find it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very nice,&rdquo; the widow said, smiling
almost in a friendly way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember it always
when I am far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you intend to leave Riverview?&rdquo; Louise
asked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must sell Rose Acres. I have no other course open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to Jay Franklin, I hope!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of dealing with him if anyone
else will make an offer. So far I have found no other
person who is interested in the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing a deep sigh, Mrs. Marborough arose.
Without much enthusiasm she invited the girls to come
with her into the house, but they tactfully declined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo;
Penny said as she and Louise turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Marborough. &ldquo;We might make
a final search for the pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enroute to Riverview, the girls talked over the situation
and agreed that the prospect of finding the necklace
was a slim one. They had grown to like the eccentric
widow and were sorry that she had decided to
move away from the city of her birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure if she had money she would remain
here,&rdquo; Louise declared. &ldquo;And it will nearly kill her
if she is forced to deal with Jay Franklin. How she
does dislike him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parting with her chum in the business section of
Riverview, Penny went directly to the <i>Star</i> office.
Her father was ready to start home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new about Jay Franklin and those record
stones he hopes to sell to the museum?&rdquo; Penny inquired
absently as the automobile sped along the congested
streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you haven&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; Mr. Parker replied.
&ldquo;Franklin expects to make the sale and probably will.
The museum people have put themselves on record as
saying that the stones bear authentic writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it appears that your original hunch was incorrect,&rdquo;
Penny observed. &ldquo;Too bad you played
down the story in the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I may have made a mistake. All the same, I am
pinning my hopes on the expert from Brimwell College.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What expert, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I neglected to tell you. The <i>Star</i> hired
Professor Anjus from Brimwell to inspect the stones.
His opinion doesn&rsquo;t coincide with that of the museum
experts. He has pronounced them fakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the experts can&rsquo;t agree, then how can one prove
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something of a tangle,&rdquo; Mr. Parker smiled.
&ldquo;I turned that tool you obtained from Crocker over
to Professor Anjus. He expects to make exhaustive
tests and to report to me within a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car had reached the outskirts of Riverview. As
it passed along streets which were sparsely dotted with
houses, Penny called attention to several large billboards
which disfigured the landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dad!&rdquo; she directed, pointing to a particularly
colorful poster. &ldquo;An Indian show is coming to
town next week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker turned his head to gaze at the billboard.
To Penny&rsquo;s amazement, he suddenly slammed on the
brake, bringing the car to a lurching halt at the side of
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he cried, his eyes on the huge sign.
&ldquo;The motive! I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out, but now I have
the clue I need! Penny, we&rsquo;ll put a crimp in Jay
Franklin&rsquo;s little game, or my name isn&rsquo;t Anthony
Parker!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>PUBLICITY PLUS</i></h2>
<p>Completely mystified by her father&rsquo;s remarks,
Penny waited for him to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get it?&rdquo; he asked, waving his hand toward
the big signboard. &ldquo;The finding of those stones
bearing Elizabethan and Indian writing was perfectly
timed! It&rsquo;s all a publicity stunt for the coming show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it be?&rdquo; Penny questioned, scarcely able
to accept her father&rsquo;s theory. &ldquo;I found one of the
rocks myself. I know I wasn&rsquo;t hired by any Indian
show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was pure luck that you stumbled into the stone,
Penny. If you hadn&rsquo;t, someone hired by the Indian
show would have brought it to light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where does Jay Franklin figure in, Dad? You
don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s connected with the publicity scheme
as you call it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Franklin wouldn&rsquo;t have sufficient imagination to
pull off a stunt like that,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared. &ldquo;No,
he may actually believe in the authenticity of the
stones. At any rate, he saw an opportunity to make a
little money for himself and seized it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should an Indian show go to the trouble of
having stones carved and planted in various fields? It
doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The resulting publicity should draw state-wide attention
to the show, Penny. It&rsquo;s just the sort of idea
which would appeal to a clever publicity agent. Every
newspaper in Riverview except the <i>Star</i> has fallen
for it, giving columns of space to the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t see how the show will gain. Its name
never has been mentioned in connection with the
finding of the stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Penny. That would be too crude.
But at the proper time, the publicity agent will twist
all of the stories to his own purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; said Penny sadly, &ldquo;in the past you have accused
me of having wild ideas. I think the score is
even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that show traced,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared,
paying no heed to his daughter. &ldquo;Since it is coming to
Riverview next week it can&rsquo;t be far away now. I may
find it worth while to call on the publicity agent and
have a little chat with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was gazing at the billboard again, reading the
dates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, the show will play here during Pilgrimage
Week,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;What a shame! It&rsquo;s certain to
take away customers from a much more worthwhile
event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may not be an Indian show,&rdquo; responded Mr.
Parker grimly. &ldquo;Not when I get through with the
outfit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately upon arriving at home, the publisher
called the newspaper office, delegating City Editor DeWitt
to obtain complete information about the Indian
Show and to report to him. All evening he talked of
his theory until both Penny and Mrs. Weems confessed
that they were a bit weary of redskins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall write an editorial for tomorrow&rsquo;s <i>Star</i>,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker announced. &ldquo;Even if I haven&rsquo;t absolute facts,
I&rsquo;ll drop a few broad hints about those fake stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editorial, cleverly worded but with very definite
implications, was composed that night, and telephoned
to the newspaper office. Penny had the pleasure
of reading it at breakfast the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did yourself proud, Dad,&rdquo; she
praised. &ldquo;However, I imagine the museum people
aren&rsquo;t going to be too pleased. Nor certain other folks
in this town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take a look at it,&rdquo; Mr. Parker requested,
reaching for the paper.</p>
<p>As Penny offered it to him, the doorbell rang. Mrs.
Weems was busy in the kitchen so the girl arose and
went to answer it. Jay Franklin stood on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said in a hard voice. &ldquo;Is your
father here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is eating breakfast,&rdquo; Penny responded.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin walked ahead of her into the living
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Jay,&rdquo; called the editor, who was
able to see the caller from his chair at the breakfast
table. &ldquo;Will you have a cup of coffee with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the invitation, Mr. Franklin entered the
dinette, blocking the doorway. From his pocket he
took a copy of the morning <i>Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parker,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just read your editorial
and I demand an explanation! Do you realize
what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Written a pretty fair stickful&mdash;or so my daughter
tells me,&rdquo; Mr. Parker smiled undisturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve deliberately tried to smear me,&rdquo; the real
estate man accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall that your name was mentioned in the
editorial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you know I expect to sell those two stones
to the museum. This editorial of yours may queer the
sale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it will have fulfilled its purpose. The stones
are fakes. If you aren&rsquo;t aware of it, I suggest that you
acquaint yourself with the true facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those stones bear genuine Elizabethan writing.
There&rsquo;s no connection with any cheap Indian show,
and I defy you to prove it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Consider your challenge accepted,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Parker evenly. &ldquo;I expect to publish the true facts very
shortly in the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you prevent me from making a sale to the
museum, I&rsquo;ll sue you!&rdquo; Jay Franklin threatened.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I have to say. Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his anger he turned so quickly that he ran into
Penny who stood directly behind him. Without bothering
to apologize, he brushed past her, out the front
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful man!&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Weems
who had heard the conversation from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather expected him to call, although not so early
in the morning,&rdquo; the publisher remarked, reaching for
a slice of toast. &ldquo;His attitude doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may actually sue you if you don&rsquo;t make good
on producing facts,&rdquo; Penny commented. &ldquo;How are
you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;DeWitt informs me that the Indian Show is playing
at Bryan this week. I&rsquo;ll drive over there today and see
what I can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bryan was a small city located sixty-nine miles from
Riverview. Although Penny ordinarily would have
spent the day in school, she immediately decided that
her father would need her assistance. Accordingly,
she begged so hard to accompany him that he finally
gave his consent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Early afternoon saw Mr. Parker and his daughter at
the outskirts of Bryan where two large blue and red
show tents had been set up. A band played, and
townspeople were pouring past the ticket-taker, an
Indian who wore the headdress of a chieftain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks rather interesting,&rdquo; Penny remarked wistfully.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker stripped a bill from his wallet and gave
it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go buy yourself a ticket,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
meet you here by the entrance in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see the show, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve outgrown such foolishness,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
find the publicity agent and have my little talk with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enticing sound of tom-toms and Indian war
whoops caused Penny to forget her desire to meet the
show&rsquo;s publicity man. Saying goodbye to her father,
she bought a ticket and hastened into the big top. For
an hour she sat through a very mediocre performance,
consisting in the main part of cowboy and Indian
horseback riding. The concluding event, a tableau,
depicted an attack by redskins upon an early English
colony settlement. It was all very boring, and Penny
left in the middle of the performance.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker was not waiting at the entrance way.
Loitering about for a time, she inquired of a workman
and learned that her father was in one of the small
tents close by. The flap had been rolled back, permitting
her to see a sharp-faced man of thirty who sat
at a desk piled with papers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the show&rsquo;s publicity agent?&rdquo; she asked the
workman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, Bill McJavins,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure put
new life into this outfit. We&rsquo;ve been packin&rsquo; them in
ever since he took over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few minutes Mr. Parker joined Penny and
from the expression of his face, she immediately
guessed that his interview had not been very successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it that Bill McJavins didn&rsquo;t break down and
confess all?&rdquo; she inquired lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He denied any connection with those stones found
in Riverview,&rdquo; Mr. Parker replied. &ldquo;But in the next
breath he admitted he knew all about them and intends
to capitalize on the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how will it help the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what McJavins told me, I gather the program
includes an historical pageant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a flattering name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the pageant, Indians attack a white settlement.
A beautiful maiden escapes, and chisels on a stone
tablet an account of the massacre&mdash;then she, too, succumbs
to the tomahawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know more about the show than I,&rdquo;
Penny laughed. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad to learn how it
came out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my guess that McJavins hopes to profit by a
tie-up between the stone writing of the pageant and
the finding of similar rocks near Riverview. It&rsquo;s a
cheap trick, and the hoax would have been exposed
a long time ago if museum authorities were awake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Neither discouraged nor too much elated by the results
of the trip, Mr. Parker and Penny returned to
Riverview. It was exactly noon when they reached
the newspaper office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you plan to attend school this afternoon,&rdquo;
the editor reminded his daughter. &ldquo;By lunching
downtown you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loitering about the newsroom as long as she dared,
Penny crossed the street to have a sandwich at a quick-lunch
cafe. As she reached the restaurant she observed
a familiar figure coming toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda Wiegand!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going
in the wrong direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cutting classes for the afternoon,&rdquo; the trailer
camp girl replied, pausing. &ldquo;Mr. Coaten expects me to
meet him at the Fischer Building. Can you tell me
where it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three blocks straight down the street,&rdquo; Penny directed.
She hesitated and then said: &ldquo;Rhoda, it&rsquo;s none
of my affair, but I do hope you&rsquo;re not agreeing to Mr.
Coaten&rsquo;s proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The adoption? Yes, I am, Penny. I&rsquo;ve tried to
hold out against them all, but I can&rsquo;t do it. Ted signed
the papers two days ago. Since then I&rsquo;ve had no peace.
Ted keeps after me, the Breens want me to do it, and
Mr. Coaten says I am selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both know Mr. Coaten intends to profit in
some way at your expense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do feel that way about it. If only I dared stand
firm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; Penny said earnestly. Deliberately
taking Rhoda&rsquo;s arm she turned her about. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to
break that appointment and have luncheon with me.
I&rsquo;ll assume all the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>RHODA&rsquo;S PROBLEM</i></h2>
<p>Rhoda allowed herself to be dissuaded, but not
without misgiving. As she lunched with Penny at the
Dolman Cafe, she painted a gloomy picture of what
lay before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand how it is,&rdquo; she said, slowly
stirring a cup of hot chocolate. &ldquo;I really haven&rsquo;t a
good reason for refusing to consent to the adoption.
If I had one scrap of evidence against Mr. Coaten it
would be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you write to Texas and inquire about him
and his friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Rhoda admitted. &ldquo;The answer came back
that Mr. Coaten was unknown at the address he gave
the Breens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that would be sufficient reason for
distrusting him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Coaten explained it by saying that his
family just moved to a new house, and that he inadvertently
had given me the wrong address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ask for the second one, Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he gave it to me. So far I&rsquo;ve not had time for
a reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice is to stall for time,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;If we
have even a few days more we may dig up some information.
However, I&rsquo;ll confess I haven&rsquo;t an idea at
the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Coaten will be furious because I didn&rsquo;t keep
the appointment,&rdquo; Rhoda sighed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s certain to
come to the trailer camp tonight and demand an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tell him you changed your mind and refuse
to say anything more. I wish I could talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; declared Rhoda with emphasis. &ldquo;Why
not take dinner with us tonight&mdash;if you can stand our
brand of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Penny hesitated. &ldquo;Louise
and I plan to go to Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s place directly
after school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I could go with you!&rdquo; Rhoda declared
impulsively. &ldquo;I never have had an opportunity to finish
my sketch. Mrs. Marborough is such an interesting
character, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half of it,&rdquo; laughed Penny.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to come along. I think Mrs. Marborough
will be willing to share our secret with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secret?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No questions now, please,&rdquo; Penny requested, capturing
both luncheon checks. &ldquo;We must hurry or
we&rsquo;ll be late for school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having assured Mrs. Marborough that she would
disclose nothing about the lost pearl necklace, she
could not honorably share the adventure with her
friend. However, it was her hope and belief that the
widow would be willing to allow Rhoda to aid in the
exciting search of the premises.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s surmise proved entirely correct. Later
that afternoon when the three girls called at Rose
Acres, Mrs. Marborough scarcely noticed that Rhoda
was an uninvited member of the party. At once she
began talking of the missing pearls, which to the satisfaction
of Louise and Penny, necessitated a complete
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine finding a tunnel leading from the old wishing
well to the house!&rdquo; Rhoda cried in delight. &ldquo;Take
me through it! Show me everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can find the pearls,&rdquo; Penny laughed.
&ldquo;So far Louise and I have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re supposed to be hidden somewhere near
the old wishing well,&rdquo; Louise contributed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the only real clue we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you looked under the flagstones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did that many days ago,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Marborough.
&ldquo;In fact, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single place
I haven&rsquo;t searched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The roof of the well?&rdquo; Rhoda suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We never once thought of that place!&rdquo; Louise exclaimed.
&ldquo;But how could the necklace be secreted
there?&rdquo; She frowned as she stared at the steep-pitched,
shingled covering which formed a protection
over the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth looking at anyhow!&rdquo; Penny declared.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a ladder if I can find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the woodshed,&rdquo; directed Mrs. Marborough.</p>
<p>Penny soon returned carrying a dust-laden step-ladder
which had not seen service in many years.
Bracing it against the well, she mounted and began to
inspect the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo; inquired Rhoda impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two birds&rsquo; nests. There seems to be a hole under
the edge of the roofing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny broke off as she ran her hand into the narrow
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is something here!&rdquo; she exclaimed a moment
later. &ldquo;It feels like a tiny box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough and the two girls waited tensely,
hardly daring to hope. Penny withdrew her hand
from the hole, triumphantly holding up a small leather
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough cried. &ldquo;It is the
old jewel case. The pearls must be inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her haste to climb down from the ladder, Penny
missed one of the steps. Rhoda seized her arm saving
her from a hard fall. Recovering her breath, Penny
politely offered the jewel case to Mrs. Marborough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>With the three girls clustered about her, the mistress
of Rose Acres ceremoniously opened the lid. In a nest
of yellowed silk lay a string of matched pearls, so
beautiful and lustrous that no one could find words to
admire it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The famous Marborough pearls,&rdquo; the widow murmured
at last. &ldquo;This necklace brought only unhappiness
to our family. Now, however, they shall serve a
useful purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls gazed at Mrs. Marborough expectantly,
waiting for her to continue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall sell the pearls,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;They represent
a small fortune, and by disposing of them I&rsquo;ll be
well-provided for in my old age. It won&rsquo;t be necessary
for me to pinch and skrimp. I&rsquo;ll be able to hold
my head up in society&mdash;live like a human being again
instead of a recluse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that she was revealing a great deal, Mrs.
Marborough snapped shut the jewel case and smiled
at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never should have found the pearls by myself.
To tell you that I am grateful scarcely expresses my
feelings. You&rsquo;ve saved me from poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda did it,&rdquo; Penny declared, giving full credit to
the trailer-camp girl. &ldquo;Louise and I never would have
thought of searching the roof of the well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come inside,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough invited gaily.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have tea in my kitchen. It&rsquo;s not much to offer,
but I did bake a little sponge cake this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>No longer ashamed of the barren condition of the
old mansion, the widow led the girls through the great
empty rooms. By daylight, notwithstanding the
stained condition of the walls, the house seemed more
elegant than ever. There was a large fan-shaped window
of stained glass which Penny had not noticed before,
and dozens of candle holders attached to the
walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How gorgeous this place would look if all the candles
could be lighted at one time,&rdquo; she remarked admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the house had a little furniture in it,&rdquo; added
Mrs. Marborough. &ldquo;You know, a few days ago I did
a very foolish thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise glanced quickly at Penny but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a bit hard pressed for money,&rdquo; the widow resumed.
&ldquo;On an impulse I sold all my furniture to Mr.
Butterworth. Do you suppose he will sell it back to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should,&rdquo; declared Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Riverview for I was born here,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
went on, talking as if to herself. &ldquo;By selling
the pearls I can refurnish the house, have the grounds
restored to their original beauty, and live as I formerly
did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope you decide to stay here,&rdquo; Penny said
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Mrs. Marborough started a fire in the kitchen stove
and put a kettle of water on to boil. Soon the tea was
ready, and was served with generous slices of yellow
sponge cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose everyone in Riverview considers me a
crotchety old woman,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough remarked
presently. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been very friendly because I
didn&rsquo;t want folks to know I had sold my furniture.
Some days ago a group of women came to see me about
opening the house for some sort of Festival&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilgrimage Week,&rdquo; Penny supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned them down, not because I wasn&rsquo;t eager to
help, but because I couldn&rsquo;t let folks know all my
furniture was gone. I wonder if they would still care
to include Rose Acres in the tour of houses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Marborough, it would practically save
the Festival!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;A cheap Indian show is
coming to town the same week. I know for a fact that
the Festival tickets aren&rsquo;t selling very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone wants to see Rose Acres,&rdquo; Louise added
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can re-purchase my furniture, I&rsquo;ll be glad to
open the house to the public,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough said,
her eyes twinkling as she gazed directly at Penny.
&ldquo;That was the wish you made at the well, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was! And you&rsquo;ll make it come true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little enough to do in return for the favor you
have bestowed upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will please me more than to see this old
house in all its glory!&rdquo; Penny declared enthusiastically.
&ldquo;May we light all the candles at one time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to hold a grand ball here
with everyone dressed in colonial costume!&rdquo; Penny
went on. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just see the place with beaux and
their ladies dancing a quadrille?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to the members of the Festival Committee
tomorrow,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough promised. &ldquo;My first
call, however, will be upon Mr. Butterworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long shadows were falling, and the girls soon arose
to depart. During the walk into Riverview, Rhoda
became rather sober and Penny shrewdly guessed that
she had forgotten about the Marborough pearls and
was thinking of the dreaded interview with Mr.
Coaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really afraid to meet that man aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly afraid,&rdquo; Rhoda responded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
waiting though, I&rsquo;m sure. I just don&rsquo;t know what to
tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be easier for you if I go with you to the
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you would, Penny!&rdquo; Rhoda said gratefully.</p>
<p>Louise soon parted with her friends, and the two
girls went on to the trailer camp. Mrs. Breen immediately
informed them that Mr. Coaten had called earlier
in the afternoon and expected to return again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t make trouble about signing the
papers,&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;He acted quite upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I broke our appointment,&rdquo; Rhoda responded
briefly. &ldquo;So far I&rsquo;ve not made up my mind what
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a lengthy argument in which Mrs.
Breen assured the girl that she was making a serious
mistake by antagonizing such a kind, generous man as
Mr. Coaten. Penny took no part in the conversation,
although she readily could see how difficult had become
Rhoda&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stay to dinner now,&rdquo; Rhoda whispered
to her. &ldquo;Mr. Coaten is certain to come, and I
can&rsquo;t stand against them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had no desire to remain for a meal, but feeling
that she should support her friend, accepted the invitation.
Ted soon came home from working at Judge
Harlan&rsquo;s office, and he too expressed displeasure because
his sister had broken the appointment with Mr.
Coaten.</p>
<p>During dinner the subject was studiously avoided.
Somewhat to Penny&rsquo;s disapproval, Rhoda began to tell
the Breens about everything that had occurred at Rose
Acres. At mention of the pearl necklace, Ted&rsquo;s fork
clattered against his plate and he forgot to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You actually found a string of pearls?&rdquo; he asked
incredulously. &ldquo;Real ones?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must be worth many thousand dollars,&rdquo;
Rhoda assured him. &ldquo;Mrs. Marborough intends to sell
them and use the money to remodel her place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted was about to ask another question, then seemed
to reconsider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More stew?&rdquo; Mrs. Breen asked as an awkward silence
fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, Mom,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse
me, I&rsquo;ll skip out. I have a date uptown with a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Breen made no reply and the boy left the
trailer. Penny thought that she too should be leaving,
but before she could speak, there came a light tap on
the door. Mr. Breen thrust his head out the open
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Coaten,&rdquo; he announced in a hoarse whisper.
&ldquo;What are you going to tell him Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered, gazing helplessly at
Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>MRS. MARBOROUGH&rsquo;S LOSS</i></h2>
<p>Mrs. Breen hastily removed her apron and opened
the door to admit the caller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said Mr. Coaten. His gaze roved
from one person to another in the crowded little room,
coming to rest upon Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t keep our appointment this
afternoon,&rdquo; she said stiffly. &ldquo;The truth is, I&rsquo;ve
changed my mind about signing that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to talk sense into her,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen broke
in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over the girl lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Coaten seated himself on the day bed, smiling
at Rhoda in a friendly way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand how you feel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are
afraid you don&rsquo;t know me well enough to agree to the
adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of you until you came to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, that&rsquo;s no way to talk!&rdquo; Mrs. Breen reprimanded.
&ldquo;What would we have done without Mr.
Coaten? He&rsquo;s given us money, bought groceries, and
made everything much easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appreciate everything. It&rsquo;s just that&mdash;well, I
don&rsquo;t care to be adopted. I like things as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Breen&rsquo;s kindly face tightened into hard lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;this is an opportunity for
you, and you ought to be smart enough to realize it.
Mr. Coaten will give you good clothes and schooling.
Pop and I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me too much now,&rdquo; Rhoda murmured,
her gaze on the linoleum rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been patient with you, but now I&rsquo;m going to
have my say. We can&rsquo;t keep you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me to go?&rdquo; Rhoda gasped, scarcely
believing that she had heard correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you to sign whatever it is that Mr.
Coaten wants you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda gazed at Penny, her lips trembling. There
seemed but one course open to her, for she had no
money and no relatives. Fully aware of her predicament,
Mr. Coaten smiled triumphantly. From his
pocket he whipped out a fountain pen and a folded,
neatly-typed paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, don&rsquo;t sign unless you really wish to,&rdquo; Penny
said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have no home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may stay with me. I&rsquo;ll find a place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directing her gaze upon Mr. Coaten, Penny resumed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask why you are so eager to obtain a guardianship
over Ted and Rhoda? What do you expect
to gain by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Coaten&rsquo;s voice was
soft but his eyes glinted angrily. &ldquo;I expect to gain
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gathered a different impression when I heard you
and your friend talking a night or so ago at the Marborough
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Mr. Coaten did not appear to understand,
then as Penny&rsquo;s meaning dawned upon him, he arose
from the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to discuss this matter with you&mdash;a
stranger,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;For some reason you are
prejudiced against me, and have deliberately influenced
Rhoda to go against Mrs. Breen&rsquo;s desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question for our own family to settle,&rdquo; Mrs.
Breen added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go at once,&rdquo; said Penny. She gazed questioningly
at Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think you could take me in at your
place?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. My offer holds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come with you!&rdquo; Darting to a wardrobe
closet, Rhoda began to toss garments into a suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, you can&rsquo;t go like this!&rdquo; Mrs. Breen cried in
protest. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you listen to reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; Mr. Coaten said harshly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
come back in a day or two glad to accept my offer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Rhoda paid no heed to the conversation which
flowed about her. Swiftly she packed her suitcase and
told Penny that she was ready to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Breen,&rdquo; she said, squeezing the woman&rsquo;s hand
in parting, &ldquo;you and Pop have been wonderful to Ted
and me. I&rsquo;ll never forget it&mdash;never. Someday I&rsquo;ll
repay you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way you do it,&rdquo; Mrs. Breen retorted
bitterly. &ldquo;By defying my wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be said. Penny and
Rhoda quickly left the trailer, carrying the suitcase
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; the girl murmured contritely.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll ever manage to make
a living. Ted likely will side against me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of anything tonight,&rdquo; Penny advised,
although she too was worried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find something
for you. Dad may have an opening on the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems long ago had ceased to be surprised
by anything that Penny did, and so, when the two
girls arrived at the Parker home, she did not ask many
questions. Rhoda was comfortably established in the
guest room and made to feel that she was welcome.
However, ultimately learning what had occurred, the
housekeeper was not at all certain that Penny had done
right by helping the girl to leave home. Nor was Mr.
Parker encouraging about the prospects of finding employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can she type or take shorthand?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Penny admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Star</i> can&rsquo;t be made a catch-all for your unemployed
friends,&rdquo; Mr. Parker resumed severely. &ldquo;My
advice is to send her back to the Breens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, Dad. You don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let it ride for a few days,&rdquo; her father replied,
frowning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tried to keep Rhoda from realizing that her
presence in the household had created a problem. In
the morning the girls went to school together, returned
for lunch, and then attended the afternoon session.
Rhoda became increasingly gloomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, this can&rsquo;t go on indefinitely,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get a job somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me worry about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted hasn&rsquo;t come to see me either,&rdquo; Rhoda went on
nervously. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m beginning to think I should go
back and sign that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even consider it,&rdquo; Penny said firmly. &ldquo;You
need diversion to keep your mind off the problem.
Let&rsquo;s hike out to the Marborough place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carrying their books, the girls set off for Rose
Acres. Several windows on the lower floor of the
house had been opened to admit fresh air and the blinds
no longer were drawn. For the first time since Mrs.
Marborough&rsquo;s return, the old mansion actually had a
&ldquo;lived in&rdquo; appearance. However, although Penny
knocked many times, the widow did not come to the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be here,&rdquo; Rhoda remarked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windows are open,&rdquo; Penny said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I doubt that Mrs. Marborough would go very far
away without closing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls wandered to the wishing well, and then
made a complete tour of the grounds. Mrs. Marborough
was nowhere in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; Rhoda asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll knock on the door just once more,&rdquo; Penny said.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling that she is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Circling the house to the side entrance, the girls
again rapped and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Penny suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; declared Rhoda, startled by
the manner in which her companion had given the
command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought someone called or groaned&mdash;the sound
came from inside the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have imagined it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I did,&rdquo; Penny acknowledged, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Testing the door, she found it unlocked. As it
swung back a tiny crack, she called loudly: &ldquo;Oh, Mrs.
Marborough, are you at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Distinctly, both girls heard an answering cry, but
the words were unintelligible. The sound had come
from the direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough must be ill!&rdquo; Penny gasped, for
the voice had been very weak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Hesitating no longer, she entered the house, and
with Rhoda trailing close behind, ran to the kitchen.
Mrs. Marborough, still garbed in night clothing, lay
on the daybed, her face ashen. The woman breathed
with the greatest of difficulty, and both girls knew at
once that she was seriously ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough whispered. &ldquo;An
attack&mdash;last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, run as fast as you can and get Doctor
Hamilton,&rdquo; Penny said tersely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as her friend had gone, she busied herself
trying to make Mrs. Marborough comfortable. She
rearranged the disordered blankets, and fanned air toward
the woman, making it easier for her to breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pearls,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough whispered after a
moment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thought little of the remark, deciding that the
widow was not entirely rational.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have the necklace,&rdquo; she said soothingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember? We found it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough repeated. &ldquo;It gave me
such a shock&mdash;I had hidden the pearls in the teapot.
This morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny bent closer, suddenly realizing that the old
lady was in possession of her faculties and was trying
to disclose something of great importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went there this morning,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough completed
with difficulty. &ldquo;The pearls were gone.
They&rsquo;ve been stolen. Now I have nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>THE MISSING NECKLACE</i></h2>
<p>Penny tried to quiet the old lady by assuring her
that the pearl necklace must be somewhere in the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, it is gone,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough insisted.
&ldquo;A thief entered the house during the night. The
shock of it brought on this attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spent by the effort required to speak, the widow
closed her eyes, and relaxed. Thinking that she had
gone to sleep, Penny left the bedside for a moment.
A quick glance assured her that the kitchen window
was open, and far more alarming, the screen had been
neatly cut from its frame. An empty China teapot
stood on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be true!&rdquo; Penny thought with a sinking
heart. &ldquo;The pearls have been stolen, and the shock of
it nearly killed Mrs. Marborough! But who could
have known that she had the necklace here in the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Louise and Rhoda were beyond suspicion, and for a
moment she could think of no others who had knowledge
of the pearls. Then, with a start, it came to her
that the story had been told the previous night at the
Breens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted knew about it and he was interested!&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t believe he would do such a contemptible
thing&mdash;even if he did once steal a chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s unhappy reflections were broken by the arrival
of Rhoda with Doctor Hamilton. For the next
half hour the girls were kept more than busy carrying
out his instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough, in a way you have been very
fortunate,&rdquo; the doctor said as he finally prepared to
leave the house. &ldquo;Your attack has been a light one and
with proper care you should be on your feet again
within a week or two. I&rsquo;ll arrange to have you taken
to the hospital at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow tried to raise up in bed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;
she announced. &ldquo;Hospitals cost money&mdash;more than I
have to spend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t cost you anything, Mrs. Marborough. I&rsquo;ll
arrange everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to be a charity patient,&rdquo; the widow declared
defiantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die first! Go away and take
your pills with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you refuse hospital care, I must arrange
for a nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford that either,&rdquo; the old lady snapped.
&ldquo;Just go away and I&rsquo;ll get along by myself. I&rsquo;m feeling
better. If I could only have a cup of tea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it for you,&rdquo; Rhoda offered eagerly.</p>
<p>Penny signaled to the doctor, indicating that she
wished him to follow her into another room. Once
beyond the hearing of the old lady, she outlined a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough likes Rhoda very much,&rdquo; she said
to the doctor. &ldquo;I think she might be perfectly satisfied
to be looked after by her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl seems sensible and efficient,&rdquo; Doctor
Hamilton replied. &ldquo;But would she be willing to
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she might for she has no home of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relieved to have the problem solved so easily, the
doctor declared that the plan could be tried for a few
days at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop in again late tonight,&rdquo; he promised, picking
up his bag.</p>
<p>Consulted by Penny, Rhoda said at once that she
would be happy indeed to remain with Mrs. Marborough
as long as her services were required. The
widow too seemed pleased by the arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; she murmured to Rhoda.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay you though. Not unless my pearls are
recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pearls?&rdquo; the girl echoed in astonishment.</p>
<p>Penny drew her friend aside, explaining what had
occurred. Rhoda was shocked to learn that the necklace
had been stolen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Who could have
taken the pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently it did not occur to her that her own
brother Ted might be regarded with suspicion. Penny
was much too kind to drop such a hint, and kept her
thoughts strictly to herself.</p>
<p>However, later in the day, with Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
permission, she made a full report of the theft to local
police. An officer visited Rose Acres, but aside from
establishing exactly how the house had been entered,
obtained few useful clues. Questioned at considerable
length, Penny disclosed that so far as she knew only
Louise Sidell, the trailer camp family, Ted, Rhoda and
herself had known that the pearls were in the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep that Breen family under surveillance,&rdquo;
the officer promised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know if anything
develops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another problem immediately confronted Penny.
An inspection of the cupboards of the Marborough
home had revealed that there was barely enough food
to last a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy whatever you need,&rdquo; the widow instructed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find money in the top bureau drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By diligent search, the girls found four dollars and
twenty-four cents which they felt certain was all the
money the old lady possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the medicines Doctor Hamilton ordered will
take almost this much!&rdquo; Penny said in dismay. &ldquo;Something
must be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Both girls respected Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s desire for
secrecy, but they knew it would not be possible to help
her and, at the same time, prevent the townspeople
from learning of her dire poverty. Deeply troubled,
Penny placed the problem in Mrs. Weems&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that poor woman!&rdquo; the housekeeper explained.
&ldquo;To think that she is sick and hasn&rsquo;t the
things that she needs. I&rsquo;ll send a basket of food at
once. I am sure many people will be eager to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems busied herself at the telephone, and
within a few hours, all manner of useful gifts began to
arrive at Rose Acres. Neighbors came to help Rhoda
with the housework and to care for the widow.</p>
<p>As was inevitable, the entire story of Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
poverty, including the loss of the pearl
necklace, circulated throughout Riverview. Since
there no longer was any excuse for secrecy, Penny
disclosed to members of the Pilgrimage Committee
what had become of the old lady&rsquo;s furniture and why
she had refused to open her house during Festival
Week. To her delight, a fund immediately was
raised for the purpose of re-purchasing the valuable
antiques. Mr. Butterworth, pleased to cooperate,
agreed to sell the furniture for exactly the price he had
paid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>The days drifted slowly along. Under Rhoda&rsquo;s
faithful care, Mrs. Marborough soon was able to sit up
in a wheel chair. Much subdued since the heart attack,
she had little to say even when a moving van arrived
with her household furnishings. But one afternoon
while Penny was inserting new candles in the
glass candelabrum she so much admired, the old lady
watched her from her chair by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Rhoda have fixed the house up so nicely,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very kind to me, and so have
all the folks in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a great many friends, Mrs. Marborough,&rdquo;
Penny replied, smiling. &ldquo;You never gave them a
chance to show it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have been unfriendly,&rdquo; the widow acknowledged.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be. Now that I&rsquo;d
like to show my appreciation, there&rsquo;s no way to do it.
If only the police would get busy and find the rascal
who stole my necklace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not reply immediately, for she could
think of nothing encouraging to say. She and Rhoda
both believed that the thief who had taken the pearls
never would be apprehended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;there is a
way you could show the people of Riverview how you
feel&mdash;but I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t care to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By opening my home for the Pilgrimage?&rdquo; the
widow asked, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had in mind, but of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is the Festival?&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough broke in.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost track of time since I&rsquo;ve been sick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It starts day after tomorrow.&rdquo; Penny drew a deep
sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the Festival may be a failure, for not
half enough tickets have been sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it help to include this house in the Pilgrimage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would save the Festival!&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not well enough to go through with it, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough snapped, her spirits
reviving. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better than a big party.
What pleasure is it sitting in a wheel chair staring at a
cracked wall? Now you go ahead and plan it just the
way you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With time so short, Penny flew into action. She
contacted members of the Festival Committee and
immediately a new publicity campaign was launched. It
was announced that Rose Acres would be included in
the Pilgrimage and that a grand costume ball at the
mansion would be open to the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affair is certain to be a success,&rdquo; Penny told
her father enthusiastically. &ldquo;I wish though that the
Indian Show wasn&rsquo;t playing Riverview at the same
time. By the way, have you made any further progress
in proving that Jay Franklin&rsquo;s record stones are
fakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; Mr. Parker ruefully admitted.
&ldquo;A report came back on that tool you picked up at
Truman Crocker&rsquo;s shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the verdict, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Anjus, the expert who examined the
chisel, says he believes the stones could have been
marked with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Truman Crocker may be the guilty person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at all certain. In all events, I still hold to
my original theory that the hoax was planned by Bill
McJavins of the Indian Show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope Mr. Franklin fails in trying to sell
the stones to the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed the editor. &ldquo;Unfortunately, unless
I dig up evidence very quickly, the transaction will
take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not give a great deal of thought to the
affair of the record stones for Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s illness
had centered her interest at Rose Acres. In truth,
she was far more concerned about the missing pearls.
The police had made no progress in tracing the necklace
and held scant hope the thief would be captured.</p>
<p>As for Ted Wiegand, Penny was unable to make up
her mind whether or not he was the guilty person.
Although he still worked for Judge Harlan, she seldom
saw him. Occasionally, reports of his progress were
given to her by Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted isn&rsquo;t provoked at me any more,&rdquo; she assured
Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s beginning to think as I do that Mr.
Coaten has been up to something crooked. I know for
a fact that he gave Mrs. Breen money to force me out
of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those two men still in town?&rdquo; Penny asked
thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Rhoda nodded. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been here to see me
twice. Mrs. Marborough sent them away the last
time. She dislikes them both because they once came
here to ask if they could rent rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been the night I overheard them
talking at the wishing well,&rdquo; Penny returned.</p>
<p>She remained silent a moment, thinking. Suddenly,
she glanced up, her eyes dancing. &ldquo;Rhoda, I have an
idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might not work, but if it should, we&rsquo;d learn why
Mr. Coaten is so eager to adopt you and Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you have in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, Rhoda! If we could induce Mr.
Coaten and his friend to come to Rose Acres on the
night of the costume ball, I know how they might be
made to talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong arm methods?&rdquo; Rhoda asked, slightly
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not! The old wishing well will turn the
trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have me puzzled, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting those men here will be the most difficult,&rdquo;
Penny went on, thinking aloud. &ldquo;But I can sell them
a ticket to the ball. Failing that, I&rsquo;ll give them one
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still no guarantee they would come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know how we can make sure of it! Rhoda, you
can write Mr. Coaten a note, asking him to meet you
here at ten o&rsquo;clock. The ball will be in full sway by
that time. If you hint you&rsquo;ve decided to sign the adoption
papers, he&rsquo;s certain to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then how will I get out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that part to me,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get Mr. Coaten here, and you&rsquo;re to talk with him beside
the wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in that particular place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now,&rdquo; Penny said, smiling mysteriously.
&ldquo;Just accept my word for it that it&rsquo;s of utmost
importance. As soon as you get the men at the wishing
well, make an excuse and run into the house, leaving
them together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; Rhoda asked, completely bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that point the old well and I will take over!&rdquo;
Penny laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you another thing. But
if my scheme works&mdash;and I think it will&mdash;Mr. Coaten&rsquo;s
little game will be exposed in a most dramatic way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>GRAND BALL</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Everything will be ruined&mdash;everything!&rdquo;
wailed Penny. She stood in the living room at Rose
Acres, her face pressed almost against the window
pane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been raining for an hour straight! No one
will come to the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; Rhoda said cheerfully.
&ldquo;You know over three hundred tickets were sold.
Even if the rain does cut down the crowd we&rsquo;ll still
have as many people as this house can accommodate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admiringly, her gaze wandered about the room
which glowed brilliantly with the light of dozens of
candles. Every chair was in place, flowers decorated
the vases, and at the square, old-fashioned piano, sat
Mrs. Marborough, in rustling black silk, playing a few
tinkling chords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t tire yourself,&rdquo; Rhoda said to her.
&ldquo;Not until the guests come, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never felt better in my life,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
insisted. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m as excited as a school girl! Is
Judge Harlan really coming to the ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone of consequence in Riverview will be
here,&rdquo; Rhoda assured her. &ldquo;Even two of Penny&rsquo;s special
guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what worries me,&rdquo; Penny confessed, beginning
to pace the floor. &ldquo;I have my trap all ready to
spring, but if this horrid rain keeps up, how can you
meet Mr. Coaten by the well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I talk to him in the library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Penny said patiently. &ldquo;The
entire scheme will fail unless you carry out your part
exactly as we planned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain is letting up,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough declared,
carefully moving from the piano to her wheel chair.
&ldquo;Mark my words, it will all be over within fifteen
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope so!&rdquo; Penny breathed. &ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her gratification, the rain did cease within a short
while, and members of the Festival Committee and
hired musicians began to arrive. For the occasion,
Penny, Rhoda, and Louise, had rented colonial costumes
with fancy powdered wigs. They hovered near
the front door, ready to greet the first guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a wonderful party,&rdquo; Louise remarked
happily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Soon visitors began to arrive in groups. The orchestra
struck up and the ballroom became thronged with
dancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marborough is having a marvelous time,&rdquo;
Rhoda told Louise. &ldquo;In fact, so is everyone except
Penny. She&rsquo;s worried because Mr. Coaten hasn&rsquo;t
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men alighted from a taxi and walked up the
path to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come now!&rdquo; Penny whispered excitedly.
&ldquo;Quick, Rhoda. Keep out of sight until I give the
word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barely had the girl vanished than Mr. Coaten and
his companion reached the reception line. Penny
greeted them with unusual warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Rhoda Wiegand here?&rdquo; Mr. Coaten asked curtly.
&ldquo;We came to see her, not to attend the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was around a moment ago,&rdquo; Penny answered.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look for her in the garden&mdash;perhaps
by the wishing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instant the two men had gone, Penny quickly
ran to find Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember, don&rsquo;t talk to Mr. Coaten except
at the wishing well,&rdquo; she issued final instructions.
&ldquo;Then when he asks you to sign the paper, make an
excuse and leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; Rhoda nodded. &ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t
understand what you&rsquo;re up to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Anxiously Penny watched from the porch until she
saw that her friend actually was talking to the two men
beside the wishing well. Then, running into the
crowded ballroom, she signaled the musicians to stop
the music. Clapping her hands for attention, she announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;a little surprise! The Old
Wishing Well speaks! Listen and you may hear the
conversation of unwary guests who reveal their secrets
beside it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching for a box secreted in a clump of artificial
palms, Penny turned a switch. The startled dancers
heard a crackling sound, and then Rhoda&rsquo;s voice came
in on the loudspeaker, clear and distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it over, Mr. Coaten,&rdquo; were her words.
&ldquo;Even though I can&rsquo;t understand why you wish to
adopt Ted and me I&rsquo;ll agree to the guardianship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I knew you would come to your senses,&rdquo; Mr.
Coaten answered. &ldquo;Just sign this paper and we&rsquo;ll be
able to go into court and settle everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight pause and then Rhoda said: &ldquo;Will
you excuse me a moment, Mr. Coaten? I want to run
into the house, but I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those in the ballroom had gathered close to Penny,
listening with interest to the conversation, but curious
to learn its significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she commanded, as many persons began
to comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The two men who stood alone at the wishing well
were talking again, and Penny did not intend to miss
a single word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what possessed Rhoda?&rdquo; she heard Mr.
Coaten mutter. &ldquo;Is she going to back out again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we have her nailed this time,&rdquo; the other answered.
&ldquo;That land is as good as ours! As soon as
the adoption is legal, we&rsquo;ll put in our claim. The Texano
Oil Company will pay handsomely. What those
youngsters don&rsquo;t know won&rsquo;t hurt them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words, blaring out into the ballroom, were exactly
what Penny wished to hear. Believing themselves
to be alone, the two men were making damaging
admissions. However, although it was evident that
they meant to profit at Rhoda&rsquo;s expense, she could not
understand exactly what they meant to do.</p>
<p>Judge Harlan stepped forward to inspect the radio
equipment. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;A special
joke of yours, Penelope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke,&rdquo; she assured him earnestly. &ldquo;Mr.
Coaten has been trying to force Rhoda and Ted to
agree to an adoption. We were suspicious of him, and
so we arranged this little affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the sound brought into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a microphone installed inside the wishing
well,&rdquo; Penny revealed. &ldquo;The wires run through an
underground tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very clever, very clever indeed,&rdquo; murmured the
judge. &ldquo;And the meaning of the conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Penny confessed. &ldquo;Mr. Coaten is
trying to cheat Rhoda and Ted, but how I can&rsquo;t guess.
They own no property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Coaten spoke of the Texano Oil Company,&rdquo;
the judge said thoughtfully. &ldquo;That gives me a faint
inkling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish, for at that instant Rhoda came
hurriedly into the room. Penny motioned for her to
join the group by the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda,&rdquo; said the judge, turning to her, &ldquo;did your
father own land in Texas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she replied promptly. &ldquo;The only person
in our family who owned property was grandfather.
He had a large farm but sold it long before his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the location of the property?&rdquo; inquired
the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it was near the town of Elkland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elkland! Then perhaps we have the explanation.
Less than a month ago oil was discovered in that locality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Wiegand land was sold years ago,&rdquo; Penny
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much litigation has resulted from the fact that in
the past many Texas properties were sold with oil
rights reserved,&rdquo; explained the judge. &ldquo;Now, this is
only a guess. However, if Rhoda&rsquo;s grandfather kept
such oil rights&mdash;as he may well have done&mdash;his heirs
would have indisputable claim to any income derived
from such source.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>The loudspeaker had come to life again. As the two
men at the wishing well resumed their conversation,
everyone in the ballroom strained to hear the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out of Riverview just as soon as the girl
signs the paper,&rdquo; Mr. Coaten said to his companion.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wasted enough time in this one-horse town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t say wasted,&rdquo; drawled Carl Addison.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the oil money. And that&rsquo;s not all. Take a
look at this little trinket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, followed by Mr. Coaten&rsquo;s
angry exclamation: &ldquo;The Marborough pearls! So
you stole them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful of your words,&rdquo; the other warned. &ldquo;Your
own record isn&rsquo;t so pure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never descended to stealing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Mr. Addison mocked. &ldquo;The only difference
is that you tie your packages up with legal red tape so
that no one can pin anything on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use my head! Stealing the Marborough pearls
was a stupid thing to do. You may go to prison for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no risk,&rdquo; the other retorted. &ldquo;The police
didn&rsquo;t find a single clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices died away, indicating that the two men
had moved some distance from the wishing well.
Nevertheless, everyone in the ballroom had heard
enough to realize that Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s priceless
pearls were in the possession of Mr. Coaten&rsquo;s companion,
Carl Addison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand it all now!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;Mr.
Coaten and his friend must have been standing outside
the window of the trailer that night when Rhoda told
the Breen family about finding the pearls! They
probably heard the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want those two men arrested!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough
announced in a shrill voice, propelling her wheel chair
toward the door. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t someone do something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spurred to action, Judge Harlan instructed several
men from the group to guard the estate exits. Accompanied
by Penny, Rhoda, Louise, in fact, nearly
every person who had attended the party, he strode
into the yard to confront the two conspirators. Taken
completely by surprise, Mr. Coaten and his friend did
not immediately understand the meaning of the encircling
delegation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little game is up,&rdquo; said Penny, thoroughly
savoring the moment. &ldquo;We know now that your real
reason for wanting to adopt Rhoda and Ted was to
gain control of valuable oil lands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you stole my pearl necklace!&rdquo; accused Mrs.
Marborough. &ldquo;I want it returned!&rdquo; Thoroughly incensed,
she wheeled her chair directly into Carl Addison,
seizing him by the coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I know nothing about your pearls,&rdquo; the
man blustered, shaking loose from her grasp. &ldquo;We
came to this party only because we were given free
tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Mr. Coaten said gruffly,
starting away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Penny interposed, blocking the path.
&ldquo;We have learned everything. You see, a microphone
was installed at the wishing well and it carried your
entire conversation into the ballroom for everyone to
hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Coaten and his companion, gazing at the unfriendly
faces encircling them, realized that they could
not hope to explain the situation away.</p>
<p>In a sudden break for freedom, Carl Addison ran to
the hedge and attempted to leap over it. One of the
guards at a nearby exit seized the man and brought him
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search his pockets!&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough cried.</p>
<p>Judge Harlan did as the widow demanded, but the
missing pearls were not found on either of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see!&rdquo; Mr. Coaten declared triumphantly.
&ldquo;You have falsely accused my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny suspected that Mr. Addison had disposed of
the jewel case somewhere near the hedge. Crossing to
it, she groped about on the ground. After a brief
search her hand encountered a tiny box which she
knew must contain the stolen necklace. Returning
with it, she displayed the pearls and presented them to
Mrs. Marborough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we need additional evidence to hold these
men?&rdquo; she asked Judge Harlan anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have produced more than enough,&rdquo; he replied.
Turning to the two culprits, he said sternly: &ldquo;I place
you both under arrest! Stand where you are until the
police arrive, and remember, anything you say may be
used against you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>RIVER RISING</i></h2>
<p>The exposure of Mr. Coaten and Carl Addison
had been even more dramatic than Penny had dared
hope it might be. She felt very grateful to Judge Harlan
for the vital information he had provided regarding
oil lands, and especially for the &ldquo;break&rdquo; of luck which
had made it possible to regain Mrs. Marborough&rsquo;s
necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How glad I am that I never told Rhoda I suspected
Ted of the theft,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I was very unjust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the two Texas men had been removed to jail
by Riverview police, the party went on with more gaiety
than before. Penny, the center of attention, was
forced to tell over and over how a high-school boy
friend had assisted her in installing the microphone-loudspeaker
arrangement in the old wishing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t at all certain it would work,&rdquo; she modestly
declared. &ldquo;I did hope that under the proper conditions,
those two men would talk, and they did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very clever young lady,&rdquo; praised Judge
Harlan, patting her arm. &ldquo;This will make a nice story
for your father&rsquo;s paper too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marborough did not try to express in words
her appreciation for the recovery of the heirloom
pearls. However, throughout the evening, her worshipful
gaze followed Penny wherever she went. Not
until refreshments were being served did she have an
opportunity to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penelope, you have brought me more happiness
than I deserve&mdash;you and Rhoda together. Now that I
have the pearls again, I&rsquo;ll be able to carry out a few of
my plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remain in Riverview?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall, and I&rsquo;ve been wondering&mdash;do you suppose
Rhoda and Ted would be willing to live with me?
I&rsquo;m getting old. While I&rsquo;ll have money enough I&rsquo;ll
need someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not talk to Rhoda about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall,&rdquo; Mrs. Marborough nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was pleased a few minutes later when Rhoda
relayed the widow&rsquo;s request to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you agree to it?&rdquo; she asked the girl, her eyes
twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; Rhoda laughed. &ldquo;I love Rose Acres, and
Ted and I will be together again! Mrs. Breen was
kind to us, but she has her own family. Mrs. Marborough
needs someone to care for her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think the arrangement will be an ideal one,&rdquo;
Penny declared. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I meant to tell you. Judge
Harlan has promised to look after your legal interests.
With him working on the case those oil rights are the
same as yours right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the night wore on, additional guests arrived at
Rose Acres, crowding the spacious rooms. Nevertheless,
shortly before midnight, Penny was surprised to
see her father&rsquo;s car drive up to the door, for she had
not expected him to attend the party. Mr. Parker was
accompanied by a reporter, Jerry Livingston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you two news hawks here?&rdquo; Penny
asked, running outside to greet the newcomers. &ldquo;You
must have heard about Mr. Coaten and the pearl necklace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s not why we came,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
tersely replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a break in the dam
above Cedarville and the river is rising fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Acres isn&rsquo;t in danger?&rdquo; gasped Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water shouldn&rsquo;t come this high, but the flats
will be inundated within a few minutes. Everyone is
being warned to get out fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not been able to telephone Truman
Crocker,&rdquo; Jerry added. &ldquo;His shack has no &rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we drive down there?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;Not without going miles
around. The quickest way is to take the trail at the
rear of this property. Wait, I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Darting into the house for a coat, she led her father
and Jerry to the hillside. Then, deciding to accompany
them, she went on ahead down the steep incline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light burning in the shack,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
observed a few minutes later. &ldquo;Crocker must be up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the building, the editor thumped once on
the door of the workshop and then pushed it open.
Truman Crocker was busy at his bench. Startled by
the unexpected intrusion of the three visitors, he
backed a few steps away from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;All I
did was what I was told to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker cut him short. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to warn you!
The dam at Cedarville has let go, and the river is rising
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river&mdash;&rdquo; the stonecutter faltered.</p>
<p>For a fleeting instant the man&rsquo;s gaze had roved toward
a large object covered with a piece of canvas.
As Crocker&rsquo;s words came back to Penny, she suddenly
knew why he had been so startled to see her father.
Impulsively, she darted across the room and jerked the
canvas from the object it covered. Revealed for all to
see was a large rounded rock, bearing a carving which
had not been completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A record stone!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Truman Crocker,
you are the one who planted those fakes! You&rsquo;ve been
hired by someone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the man denied, cringing away.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker strode across the room, and one glance
at the rock Penny had uncovered convinced him that
his daughter&rsquo;s accusation was a sound one. Obviously,
the stone had been treated with acid and chemicals to
give it an appearance of great age. Several Indian figures
remained uncompleted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who hired you?&rdquo; he demanded of Truman
Crocker. &ldquo;Tell the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t tellin&rsquo; nothing,&rdquo; the stonecutter returned
sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll go to jail,&rdquo; Mr. Parker retorted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a party to a fraud. It was the publicity
agent of the Indian Show who hired you. He probably
gave you a hundred dollars for the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that much,&rdquo; Crocker muttered. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you
can&rsquo;t send me to jail because all I did was fix the stones
and put &rsquo;em where he told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go to jail if you testify to the truth,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker assured him. &ldquo;All you&rsquo;ll have to do is tell
what you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to tell nothing,&rdquo; Crocker said sullenly.</p>
<p>Moving so quickly that both Jerry and Mr. Parker
were caught off guard,
<a href="#front">he wheeled and ran out the open door.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him!&rdquo; the editor barked. &ldquo;Unless he&rsquo;ll testify
against Bill McJavins we may lose a big story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Penny waited anxiously at the shack while her father
and Jerry pursued the fleeing man. Ten minutes later
they stumbled back, completely winded, to report their
failure. The laborer had hidden somewhere among
the bushes dotting the hillside, and they could not hope
to find him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without Crocker&rsquo;s story we have no more evidence
than we ever had,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared in disgust.</p>
<p>Penny tapped the big rock with the half-completed
carving. &ldquo;You have this stone, Dad. If you could
photograph it in this unfinished state, wouldn&rsquo;t it tell
its own story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no camera here, and the river is rising
fast. How long would it take you to get to town and
back, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might make it in thirty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before that time, this shack will be under water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously, Mr. Parker gazed at the dark, angry
flood which swept so close to the door of the cabin.
Inch by inch it was eating away a board walk which
led to a pier and a boat tied to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Penny suddenly cried. &ldquo;If only we could
get this stone into the boat we could float it to Riverview!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; Mr. Parker returned briefly. &ldquo;Both
would sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re completely out of luck,&rdquo; added Jerry. &ldquo;At
the rate the water is coming up, this shack will be
awash in another fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Penny went on determinedly, &ldquo;if we could
make a heavy raft, couldn&rsquo;t the stone be floated? It
might be towed behind the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A raft? There&rsquo;s nothing from which to make
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is!&rdquo; Penny pointed to several barrels, up-ended
in a dark corner of the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; cried Jerry. &ldquo;We have Crocker&rsquo;s
tools! This story means a lot to you, Chief. Isn&rsquo;t it
worth a try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is,&rdquo; Mr. Parker conceded, and then with
sudden enthusiasm: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to work. By moving
fast we may yet outwit Old Man River!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>PRECIOUS CARGO</i></h2>
<p>Working with feverish haste, Mr. Parker and
Jerry constructed a raft of eight empty barrels, wiring
them together into one solid unit. Penny aided the
two men as best she could, holding tools and offering
suggestions which were not especially appreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run outside and see that the boat is all right,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker instructed her. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let it float away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obeying, Penny discovered that already the river
was flowing in a shallow, muddy stream over the pier.
The swift current tugged at the underpinning, threatening
to carry it away. Wading through the water, she
reached the boat and drew it close to the shack where
she retied it.</p>
<p>By the time she finished, her father and Jerry had
completed the raft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How will you ever get the stone on it?&rdquo; Penny
asked anxiously. &ldquo;It must weigh several hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just watch,&rdquo; grinned Jerry.</p>
<p>During Penny&rsquo;s absence, he and Mr. Parker had constructed
a small square platform of rough boards,
equipped with four tiny rollers. Getting the stone on
it, they were able to trundle it outside to the raft with
a minimum of exertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now dump her on easy,&rdquo; Mr. Parker ordered Jerry.
&ldquo;If she sinks, our story sinks too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they rolled the heavy stone from the platform
to the raft which immediately began to settle
beneath the great weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going under!&rdquo; Penny screamed.</p>
<p>As the three watched anxiously, the raft steadied and
rode just beneath the surface of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She floats!&rdquo; Jerry cried jubilantly. &ldquo;Now unless
we have an upset or strike an object in the river, we
should make it to the Adams Street pier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a <i>Star</i> paper truck meet us there, and
haul the rock to the newspaper plant,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
added with satisfaction. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s shove off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had untied the rowboat. However, as she
prepared to step into it, her father pulled her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little trip isn&rsquo;t for you, Penny. We might
upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, Dad,&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;You
know very well I can swim circles around you. If the
boat does go under, you&rsquo;ll be glad to have me along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the editor conceded. &ldquo;Jump
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water was flowing over the floor of the Crocker
shack as the boat and the cumbersome raft started
downstream. Jerry, who had elected to steer, found
himself hard pressed to keep the prow nosing into the
waves. Mr. Parker pulled without much enthusiasm
at an extra oar supplied him, content to allow the swift
current to do most of the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fun?&rdquo; Penny demanded, snuggling close to
her father. &ldquo;Just look at the beautiful stars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the river,&rdquo; Mr. Parker retorted. &ldquo;Do you
realize that if we should strike a floating object&mdash;if
that big rock should shift&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see the lovely moon,&rdquo; Penny went on dreamily.
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s laughing at the joke we&rsquo;re going to
play on Jay Franklin in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old coot will get a shock when he reads the
<i>Star</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted, relaxing. &ldquo;So will the
publicity agent of the Indian Show. When I get
through, the outfit won&rsquo;t dare put on a performance
in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Franklin had any part in hiring
Truman Crocker to fake those record stones?&rdquo; Jerry
asked, steering to avoid a floating box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in my opinion,&rdquo; the editor replied. &ldquo;He
merely thought he would profit by selling them to the
museum at a fancy price. It was immaterial to him
whether or not he sold fake stones or real.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll certainly ruin his little business transaction,&rdquo;
chuckled Penny. &ldquo;What will be done about Truman
Crocker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him tomorrow and force him to tell the
truth&mdash;that he was hired by Bill McJavins. With this
stone as evidence, he can&rsquo;t deny his part in the hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just see that special edition of the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;
Penny asked gaily. &ldquo;A big splashy picture of this
Pilgrim Rock we&rsquo;re towing, with a story telling how
Truman Crocker faked the writing. Then, in the
next column, a yarn about Mr. Addison&rsquo;s arrest, and
the recovery of the Marborough pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a real paper,&rdquo; Mr. Parker agreed heartily.
&ldquo;By the way, how were Mr. Coaten and Carl Addison
trapped? Our reporter got the story from the police,
but he was a bit vague on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m far too modest to tell you,&rdquo; Penny laughed.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to pay me at regular space rates, I
might be induced to write the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust Penny to drive a hard bargain,&rdquo; grinned
Jerry. &ldquo;We might have guessed who was responsible,
for she never fails to be on hand for the final
round-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled as she gazed down the dark, turbulent
river. Close by she heard the deep-throated whistle
of a tug boat. Along the bank, tall buildings began to
appear, and far ahead, she could see the twinkling
lights on the Adams Street pier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked on some dandy stories together,&rdquo;
she murmured, &ldquo;but this one tops them all for a thrilling
finish. Mrs. Marborough regained her pearls,
Rhoda won a home, the two men from Texas are behind
bars, and the wishing well is equipped with a
brand new microphone! You know, I&rsquo;d like to make
one more wish down its moist old throat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you ask for this time?&rdquo; Jerry asked
banteringly. &ldquo;A safe arrival in port?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost at the pier
now. I&rsquo;d wish that Dad&rsquo;s hunk of granite would turn
into a lump of pure gold. Then I&rsquo;d truly feel as if I
were the captain of a treasure ship sailing home with
precious cargo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask for a better cargo than we have
right here,&rdquo; Mr. Parker responded heartily. &ldquo;At this
moment I would rather have our old rock than all the
gold in the world!&rdquo;</p>
